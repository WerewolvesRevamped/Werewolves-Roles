**Reporter** | Elected
__Basics__
The Reporter is notified of the roles of the dead.
__Details__
The Reporter has access to a secret channel with the roles of the dead. The roles given are impervious to powers such as the flute player or tanner. 
The roles given are always the role that player was originally assigned; a dog who chooses to become a cursed civilian, then gets turned into a wolf and finally dies will be shown to the Reporter as 'dog'. 
The Reporter is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor and no living Reporter. 
The Reporter may resign at the end of any phase. 
The Reporter gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Reporters.

__Simplified__
When there is a Mayor, a Reporter is elected. They will be able to see the starting roles of all players that have died.
