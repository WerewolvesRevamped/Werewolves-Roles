**Pyromancer** | Solo Killing - Pyro Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Pyromancer may either powder one player or ignite all currently powdered players.
__Details__
Each night the Pyromancer may either powder or ignite all currently powdered people.
When a Pyromancer chooses to ignite, all powdered players will be attacked by them. If a powdered player survives the attack, they still remain powdered. If a Pyromancer is powdered and ignited, and thus attacked, the ignition fails and the attacker is informed.
Powdering is an immediate ability, and igniting is an end-night ability. Instead of powdering the Pyromancer may also unpowder. 
If the Pyromancer's powdering fails (e.g. because their target is already powdered) they are informed that their powdering failed.
The Pyromancer is a member of the pyro team and channel. The pyro team wins when all other players are dead or unaligned.

__Simplified__
