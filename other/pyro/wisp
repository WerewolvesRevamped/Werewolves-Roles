**Wisp** | Solo Killing - Pyro Team
__Basics__
The Wisp visits a person each day, igniting them if they are powdered or powdering them if not. 
__Details__
The Wisp may visit one person each day as an *immediate ability*. If the person has been *powdered*, then the Wisp *ignites* the visited person at the *end of the day*. If the Wisp dies or is lynched during the day, the ignition will not occur.
If the visited person is not powdered, the Wisp powders that person. This is an immediate action.
The Wisp is only informed at the *end of the day* whether they *powdered* or *attacked* the person they visited.
The Wisp may not visit themself.
The Wisp is a member of the *pyro* team, but not a member of the *pyro channel*. They do not know the other members of their team. 
If the *pyros* ignite the Wisp then the Wisp will be told that they were ignited, but will not be *attacked*. Whoever ignited the Wisp will be informed the name of the player and that they could not be ignited. This message is different from other ways that the ignition could fail.
When no members of the *pyro channel* are alive, the Wisp is *immediately* informed and turns into a *pyromancer*, joining the *pyro channel*.
If several Wisps exist when the last member of the pyro channel dies, all of them turn into *pyromancers* and join the *pyro channel*.

__Simplified__
The Wisp may visit one person each day, killing them if powdered or powdering them if not.
The Wisp is a member of the pyro team, but not a member of the pyro channel. The Wisp cannot be ignited.
