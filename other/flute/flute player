**Flute Player** | Solo Power - Flute Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Flute Player may enchant a certain amount of players. 
If all living players are either enchanted or Flute team members, the Flute team wins.
__Details__
Whenever a player is enchanted, they will join a secret channel with the other enchanted players, but without the Flute Player(s). 
The Flute Player(s) may see everything said in this channel, from the safety of their own secret channel.
If an enchanted player is an investigative role, that is affected by obstructions, they will have a 60% chance that the player is displayed as a Flute Player, and a 40% chance for the inspection to happen normally, whenever they attempt to inspect a player.
This effect will disappear once all members of the flute team are dead. The players are not told when the effect disappears.
Enchanting a player is an immediate ability. They cannot enchant themselves or other members of the flute team. 
If there are multiple Flute Players, then they are one team, and they will work together. 
The Flute Player is able to enchant 1 player for every ten players in the game (rounded).
If there is more than one player in the Flute Player channel (not counting Flute Apprentices), each Flute Player will only be able to enchant 1 player for every twenty players in the game (rounded).
The amount of players used is the amount of players that are part of the game, not the alive players.
If a Flute Player loses their role, they will lose their ability to enchant players, however if there is still one or more Flute Player(s) alive, the turned Flute Player will still be asked to enchant somebody.
