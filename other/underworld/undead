**Undead** | Solo Miscellaneous - Underworld Team | Transformation
__Basics__
The Undead is a part of the vampire’s secret army and pretends to be their old role. If a demonized player is killed during the night, they will not die, and will instead lose their original role and become an Undead.
__Details__
The Undead wins together with the vampire.
A player converted into an Undead loses their previous role. However, if they were a member of a group channel, they will remain as such and will still be able to vote if applicable (though their vote will not count).  
If all members of a group have changed role or died, the group is disbanded and any abilities it may have had are lost.

__Simplified__
The Undead is a part of the vampire’s team. If a demonized player is killed during the night they turn into an Undead, losing their previous role.
