**White Werewolf** | Solo Killing - White Wolves
__Basics__
The White Werewolf is a werewolf who is not satisfied with merely killing the townsfolk; they must kill all the werewolves as well. 
Every other night, the White Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack.
__Details__
To the werewolves, the White Werewolf will appear to be just another member of the wolfpack. However, it is the White Werewolfâ€™s goal to win the game completely alone; even the other werewolves must die.
Starting with Night 2, the White Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack every other night. If they choose not to attack, they will once again have the option to attack in the following night.
Attacking a member of the wolfpack is an end-night ability. 
If only werewolves and the White Werewolf are left alive, the game will continue until either all werewolves are dead or the White Werewolf is dead.
The White Werewolf imitates the most common role in the wolfpack. The White Werewolf is strongly disguised as that role and gains all its abilities. If there are several most common roles, the most common Werewolf Miscellaneous role is picked; if there are several most common WM roles, or there are no WM roles, an arbitrary one is picked from the most common WM or wolfpack roles respectively. 
If the White Werewolf changes role, the disguise and abilities are lost.
The White Werewolf is not part of the werewolf team, but is still considered a lycan and is part of the wolfpack.

__Simplified__
Every other night, the White Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack. The White Werewolf is not part of the werewolf team but is part of the wolfpack.
The White Werewolf imitates the most common werewolf role, being disguised as such and gaining its abilities.
