**Horseman of War** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of War may doom two players. There is no time for elections whilst war is raging: during the next day they will lose their vote and cannot be elected.
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. The public vote of players doomed by the Horseman of War will not count during the day after their dooming, and should they win the election poll, the election fails and nobody is elected.
For more information check `$i doom`.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of War may doom two players, removing their public vote and making them unelectable for a day. If they attempt to doom another Horseman, they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may attack a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
