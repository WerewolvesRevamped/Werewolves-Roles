**Horseman of War** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of War may doom two players. There is no time for elections whilst war is raging: during the next day they will lose their vote and cannot be elected.
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. The public vote of players doomed by the Horseman of War will have a voting power of 0 during the day after their dooming, and should they win the election poll, the election fails and nobody is elected.
For more information check `$i doom`.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of War may doom two players, removing their public vote and making them unelectable for a day. If they attempt to doom another Horseman, they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may attack a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
