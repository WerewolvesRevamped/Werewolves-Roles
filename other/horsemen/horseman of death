**Horseman of Death** | Solo Killing - Horsemen Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of Death may doom a player. The Horseman marks the player, and they will die at the end of the following night.
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. Players doomed by the Horseman of Death will die at the end of the next night (this is not an attack).
For more information, check `$i doom`.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of Death may doom a player, killing that player at the end of the next night. If they attempt to doom another Horseman, they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may attack a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
