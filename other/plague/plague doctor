**Plague Doctor** | Unaligned Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Plague Doctor is mostly immune to the plague bearer’s disease and requires the plague team to be eliminated in order to win.
Each night, they may check a player for symptoms of the plague. Additionally, they are also able to cure players.
__Details__
As soon as the plague team is eliminated, the Plague Doctor ascends and wins. The Plague Doctor cannot win while dead.
Each night, the Plague Doctor may check a player for symptoms of the plague. The Plague Doctor will immediately be informed if and since when their target has had the plague.
Members of the plague team do not have any symptoms and will *never* show up as having the plague.
The Plague Doctor starts off with vials that can cure the plague. They have one vial for every five players in the game (rounded).
Each night, the Plague Doctor may also choose to use one of their vials to immediately cure a player. Cured players no longer have the plague and stop being contagious, however they will not be informed of this. A player that is already in the final stage of the plague (i.e. they have already been informed that they have it) is too far gone to be saved and can not be cured anymore.
If the plague bearer attempts to contaminate the Plague Doctor with one of their rodents, the Plague Doctor immediately dies (unavoidable).
Otherwise, the Plague Doctor is immune to the disease.
The Plague team cannot win while a Plague Doctor is alive.

__Simplified__
The Plague Doctor is mostly immune to the plague bearer’s disease, but dies if directly targeted by a rodent, and requires the plague team to be eliminated in order to win. As soon as the plague team is eliminated, the Plague Doctor ascends and wins.
Each night, the Plague Doctor may check one player for whether they have the plague, and may also use one of their vials to immediately cure a player.
The Plague Doctor cannot win while dead or while a Plague Team member is still alive.
