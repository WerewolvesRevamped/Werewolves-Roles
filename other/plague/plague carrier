**Plague Carrier** | Solo Miscellaneous - Plague Team
__Basics__ 
The Plague Carrier wins with the plague bearers and joins a channel with them to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Plague Carrier does not have any special abilities. If somebody tries to copy a plague bearer a Plague Carrier is created instead. 
The Plague Carrier can be a carrier of the plague but once they become contaminated they don't die and instead stay contagious for the rest of the game.
The plague bearer may not attempt to directly contaminate the Plague Carrier using one of their rodents.
The Plague Carrier cannot win while a Plague Doctor is alive.
If the last plague bearer dies, and there are vials left, the Plague Carrier stops being contagious and becomes a plague bearer.
At the start of every phase the Plague Carrier is told the amount of contagious players.
