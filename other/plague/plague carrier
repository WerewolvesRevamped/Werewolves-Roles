**Plague Carrier** | Solo Miscellaneous - Plague Team
__Basics__ 
The Plague Carrier wins with the plague bearers and joins a channel with them to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Plague Carrier does not have any special abilities. If somebody tries to copy a plague bearer, a Plague Carrier is created instead. 
The Plague Carrier can become contaminated. A contaminated Plague Carrier will never die due to the plague.
A plague bearer may not attempt to directly contaminate the Plague Carrier using one of their rodents.
If the last plague bearer dies, and there are rodents left, the Plague Carrier stops being contaminated and becomes a plague bearer.
At the start of every phase, the Plague Carrier is told the amount of living contaminated players.
