**Demonic Cupid** | Solo Miscellaneous - Hell Team
__Basics__
The Demonic Cupid is a cupid who's lover is a member of the hell team.
__Details__
If the cupid selects a lover from the hell team or if their lover joins the hell team, the cupid turns into a Demonic Cupid.
The Demonic Cupid works like the cupid, with a few exceptions: The Demonic Cupid's win condition is to win with the hell team.
Once a cupid and their lover have joined the hell team, they cannot change role or betray the team in any way.
If the cupid has a soul they lose it the moment they become a Demonic Cupid.
