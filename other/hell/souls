**Souls** | Additional Info - Hell Team
__Basics__
Members of the hell team that can use Souls - soul users - may use a Soul to protect someone from all attacks for the current night. If used in this way during a day phase, the player will be protected during the following night phase.
Using a Soul to protect a player is an immediate effect.

Soul users may use a Soul to attack a player. The player will be attacked immediately. If the attacked player is soulless or a part of the hell team, the attack fails. The method of their death is not revealed (except to coroners). 
This ability may be used during both day and night phases.

If a soul user is attacked during the night and there is a soul in the pool, the soul user will be protected and a soul will be used up automatically. A soul is used up for every attack against a soul user.
If several soul users are attacked at simultaneously and not enough souls remain in the pool to protect from each attack, the devil has priority of protection. If any souls remain in the pool after this, subsequent protections occur in random order.
When souls are used in an automatic protection, all members of the hell team are informed of who was attacked.

__Simplified__
Members of the hell team can use Souls - soul users - may use a Soul to protect or attack another player. If a soul user is attacked during the night and there is an available soul, they will be automatically protected.
