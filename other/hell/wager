**Devil's Wager** | Additional Info - Hell Team
The Devil's Wager recipient may choose one of these four options:
1) The recipient may choose to sell their soul, to attack another player. 
Selling the soul immediately adds it to the pool. At the end of the night the devil will attack the player chosen by the recipient.
If the recipient chooses a member of the hell team, they will sell their soul as normal, but the devil will not execute the attack. The recipient is not informed.

2) The recipient may choose to sell their soul, to protect a player.
Selling the soul immediately adds it to the pool. For the rest of the night the player chosen by the recipient will be protected from any attacks to target them.
The recipient may choose to protect themself.

3) The recipient may choose to sell their identity, to see another player’s role.
Checking another player is an immediate effect, and the role is shown to both the recipient and the devil. Afterwards, the devil is privately informed what role the recipient has.
Both of the investigations are affected by weak disguises. Checking the other player is affected by redirections and obstructions, but checking the recipient is not. These effects are seen from the devil’s perspective, not the recipient’s.

4) The recipient may choose to ignore the devil's wager. 

The Devil's Wager recipient may choose until the end of the night, if they have not chosen by then, the wager is automatically ignored. At the end of the night, the recipient is removed from the Wager channel.
If the Devil dies before the night ends, the recipient is not informed, but no new wager action can happen anymore. 
The recipient cannot undo selling their soul, but if they have chosen an attack, they may change the target until the end of the night, or switch to a protection instead. Protections are immediate and cannot be changed.
