**Imp** | Solo Miscellaneous - Hell Team | Transformation
__Basics__
The Imp wins with the devil and joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Imp is usually the result of someone copying the devil for various reasons. This is because the devil is too powerful for there to be two. Any case of a second devil or cerberus occuring is replaced by an Imp.
Their win condition is the same as the devilâ€™s. When an Imp is created they lose their soul and it becomes part of the hell team's pool of souls.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion of a member will fail in some manner.
