**Imp** | Solo Miscellaneous - Hell Team
__Basics__
The Imp wins with the devil and joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Imp is usually the result of someone copying the devil for various reasons. This is because the devil is too powerful for there to be two. 
Their win condition is the same as the Devilâ€™s. When an Imp is created they lose their soul and it becomes part of the hell team's pool of souls.

Members of the Hell team cannot change role or betray the team in any way.
