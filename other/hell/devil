**Devil** | Solo Killing - Hell Team
__Basics__ 
Each day, the Devil may choose one player to send the wager to. The wager recipient may choose one of four options.
The Devil can use the hell team's pool of souls.
When everyone is dead, unaligned, or soulless, the Devil wins.
__Details__
During the first phase, the Devil may choose a role as a weak disguise. This defaults to citizen.

The Devil, all other members of the Hell team, and players who have sold their soul through the wager are soulless. The souls of soulless players form Hell's soul pool. Soulless players cannot be sent the wager or attacked by any member of the Hell team (attempted attacks will silently fail).
The Devil and other members of the Hell team may use souls from the pool to protect or attack somebody. Protecting or attack a player occurs at the end of a phase. If any member is attacked at night while a soul is in the pool, a soul will automatically be used to protect them. 

During the day, the Devil must choose a player to send the wager to. The wager is sent at the start of the night, and cannot be redirected or sent to soulless players.
The wager recipient may sell their soul to protect or kill a player; they may choose to investigate the role of a player, at the cost of the devil learning the wager recipient's own role; or they may do nothing. Protections and attacks are executed by the Devil.
The result of a wager investigation is visible to both the wager recipient and the Devil, and both investigations are affected by disguises. 
A player who receives the wager for a second time must sell their soul to protect or kill a player. This defaults to protecting themself.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion or recruitment of a member will fail in some manner.

__Simplified__
Each day, the Devil may choose one player to send the wager to, who may then choose one of four options: attack, protect, investigate or ignore. Should they choose to attack or protect, their soul is sold and added to the hell team's pool.
If they choose to investigate, the Devil will learn their role, and both will learn the role of the player chosen for investigation.
The Hell team can use souls to protect or attack players.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion of a member will fail in some manner.

When everyone is dead, unaligned, or soulless, the Devil wins.
