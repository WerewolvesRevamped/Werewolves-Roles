**Devil** | Solo Killing - Hell Team
__Basics__ 
Each day, the Devil may choose one player to send the wager to. The wager recipient may choose one of four options.
The Devil can use the hell team's pool of souls.
When everyone is dead, unaligned, or soulless, the Devil wins.
__Details__
During the first phase, the Devil may choose a role as a weak disguise. This defaults to citizen.

At the start of the game, the Devil's soul is added to the hell team's soul pool. The Devil then becomes soulless.
The Devil may use souls from the pool to protect or attack somebody. If the Devil is attacked while a soul is in the pool, a soul will automatically be used to protect the Devil. 
See `$info souls` for a detailed explanation.

The wager is sent at the start of the night. The wager cannot be sent to a soulles player or redirected.
During the night, the Devil can anonymously communicate with the wager recipient.
The wager recipient may sell their soul to protect or kill a player; they may choose to investigate the role of a player, at the cost of the devil learning the Wager Recipient's own role; or they may do nothing. The result of a wager investigation is visible to both the wager recipient and the Devil. 
If a player sells their soul, a soul is added to the hell team's soul pool. The player then becomes soulless.
See `$info wager` for a detailed explanation.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion or recruitment of a member will fail in some manner.

__Simplified__
Each day, the Devil may choose one player to send the wager to, who may then choose one of four options: attack, protect, investigate or ignore.
Should they choose to attack or protect, their soul is sold and added to the hell team's pool.
If they choose to investigate, the Devil will learn their role, and both will learn the role of the player chosen for investigation.
The hell team can use obtained souls for protection or to attack players.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion of a member will fail in some manner.

When everyone is dead, unaligned, or soulless, the Devil wins.
