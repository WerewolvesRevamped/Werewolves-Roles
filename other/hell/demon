**Demon** | Solo Killing - Hell Team
__Basics__
The Demon wins with the devil. It joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.
The Demon can use the hell team's soul pool.
__Details__
During the first phase, the Demon may choose a role as a weak disguise. This defaults to citizen.

At the start of the game, the Demon's soul is added to the hell team's soul pool. The Demon then becomes soulless.
The Demon may use souls from the pool to protect or attack a player. 
If the Demon is attacked while a soul is in the pool, a soul will automatically be used to protect the Demon. 
See `$info souls` for a detailed explanation.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion or recruitment of a member will fail in some manner.
