**Demon** | Solo Killing - Hell Team
__Basics__
The Demon wins with the devil. It joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.
The Demon can use the hell team's soul pool.
__Details__
During the first phase, the Devil may choose a role as a weak disguise. This defaults to citizen.

The Demon, all other members of the Hell team, and players who have sold their soul through the wager are soulless. The souls of soulless players form Hell's soul pool. Soulless players cannot be attacked by any member of the Hell team (attempted attacks will silently fail).
The Demon may use souls from the pool to protect or attack somebody. Protecting or attack a player occurs at the end of a phase. If the Demon is attacked at night while a soul is in the pool, a soul will automatically be used to protect them. 

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion or recruitment of a member will fail in some manner.
