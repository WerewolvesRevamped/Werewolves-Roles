This is the simplified version of the Werewolves Revamped Rule Book. Role descriptions are simplified to only cover the most important info. The . command (e.g. ".citizen") will show the role description as listed in this document. Alternatively you can use the "$i" command.

This rule book is generated from a Github Repository. You can find it here: https://github.com/WerewolvesRevamped/Werewolves-Roles
