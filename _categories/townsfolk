The Townsfolk Team wins when all players that arenâ€™t part of the Townsfolk Team have been killed. An exception is Unaligned players, the townsfolk team does not need to kill them, however any Unaligned players that remain alive at the end of the game, but have not hit their win condition will still lose.
