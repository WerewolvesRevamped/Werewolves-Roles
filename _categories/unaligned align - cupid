'Unaligned Align - Cupid' roles are a subcategory of the unaligned align roles. The only Cupid that can exist at the start of the game is the plain Cupid. Cupids are considered a part of the Unaligned Align category, but are listed separately to avoid confusion.
All Cupids can never change roles except to other Cupid variants. Cupids are originally nonaligned, and will acquire the alignment of their lover.
