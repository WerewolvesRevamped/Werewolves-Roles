This is the default version of the Werewolves Revamped Role Book. The bot currently used on Mini Wolves Revamped and Werewolves Revamped implements all roles as they are listed in this document. Some of these roles are not considered to be "real roles", and aren’t used in Werewolves Revamped, however, they are still implemented in the bot and occasionally used in Mini Wolves. These roles can be found in section seven. The $info command will show the role description as listed in this document.

This role book is generated from a Github Repository. You can find it here: https://github.com/McTsts/Werewolves-Roles
