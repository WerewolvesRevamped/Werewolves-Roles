This is the default version of the Werewolves Revamped Rule Book. The bot currently used on Mini Wolves Revamped and Werewolves Revamped implements all roles as they are listed in this document. Some of these roles are currently in testing. These roles can be found in the last section (limited roles). The $id command will show the role description as listed in this document. Alternatively, you can use ";" (e.g. ";citizen").

This rule book is generated from a Github Repository. You can find it here: https://github.com/McTsts/Werewolves-Roles
