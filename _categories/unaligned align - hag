'Unaligned Align - Hag' roles are a subcategory of the unaligned align roles. Hags are originally coven-acquired, and acquire alignments when they are wronged. Hags are considered a part of the Unaligned Align category, but are listed separately to avoid confusion.

IMPORTANT: Hags are currently still considered to be limited roles: they are listed here due to technical reasons.
