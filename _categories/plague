'Plague Team' is the team of the Plague Bearer. Plague wins when all players are either dead, unaligned or part of the Plague team. All members of the team know each other. The Plague Doctor is not a member of the plague team, nor a solo role, they are an Unaligned role instead, but can only be used in games with the plague team.
