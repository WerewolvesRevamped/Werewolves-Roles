**Runner** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
Once per game, if attacked by a wolfish player, the Runner shall escape.
__Details__
When they are attacked by a wolfish player, the Runner will not die, but will be vulnerable to future attacks. 
If a Runner is targeted by any attack other than by a wolfish player's attack, they will die the first time. 
Runners are informed that they were attacked. If a Runner evades a wolfpack attack, the wolfpack is told their target ran away. If a Runner evades any other attack, the wolfish player responsible is informed instead.

__Simplified__
Once per game, if attacked by the werewolves, the Runner will escape.
