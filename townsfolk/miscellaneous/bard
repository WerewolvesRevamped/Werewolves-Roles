**Bard** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
Throughout the game, all abilities used on the Bard will be narrated to everyone in story time.
__Details__ 
All abilities used throughout a phase are narrated at the end of the phase. If the Bard changes roles, abilities are no longer narrated, however the role change is still narrated. 
The narrated info only reveals the ability type and not the role who used the ability. Further details are also not revealed (e.g. if a tanner disguises the Bard, it is narrated that the Bard was disguised, however the applied disguise is not revealed, nor is which role disguised the Bard).
The following general ability types exist for Bard: “attacked”, “investigated”, “disguised”, “killed”, “targeted”, “protected”, “manipulated” and “changed role”. Abilities that do not fall under one of these categories (e.g. Flute Player's enchant or Hooker's sleeping) are directly revealed.
Abilities used on the Bard while they are dead are not narrated.
Lynches and Elections are not narrated.

__Simplified__
Throughout the game, all abilities used on the Bard will be narrated to everyone in story time.
