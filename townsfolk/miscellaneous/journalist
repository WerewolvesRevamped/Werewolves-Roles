**Journalist** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Journalist can write a journal which a certain role will receive when the Journalist dies.
__Details__
The Journalist has a second secret channel. There they can write any information. When the Journalist dies, access to this channel will be granted to a player with a role that the Journalist selected. 
The Journalist can select a role and update their targeted role once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Journalist wants. The Journalist may choose to not target any role, which will stop their power from being used.
If there are several people with the same role, a random player out of those is selected. If nobody has the role (anymore), nobody gains access to the channel.
If the Journalist loses their role, the journal is lost.

__Simplified__
The Journalist can write a journal which a player with a role of their choice will receive when the Journalist dies.
