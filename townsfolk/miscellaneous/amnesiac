**Amnesiac** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Amnesiac has forgotten their role and only has a vague idea of what it was. They will remember it at the start of Night 2.
__Details__
From the start of the game until the start of Night 2, the Amnesiac is a normal citizen. At the start of Night 2, they will get to know their role. 
This role will not be known to the rest of the players, but it will be one of three townsfolk roles that the Amnesiac is told at the start of the game.
If the Amnesiac changes into a role that has a power limited to a Day or Night that has already passed, they have to use it in the following Day or Night.
If they change into a role that receives information or is part of a group at the start of the game, the Amnesiac will receive the information or join the group directly after changing role.

__Simplified__
At the start of the game, the Amnesiac will be told three townsfolk roles. At the start of Night 2, they will change into one of these roles.

__Formalized__
Starting: Target %Role%
Starting: Learn `shuffle(%Role%, %Role%, @Target)`
Passive Start Night: Role Change @Self to @Target [Temporal: Night 1]
