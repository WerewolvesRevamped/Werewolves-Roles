**Assistant** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__ 
The Assistant may select a player to redirect one werewolf action to. The action cannot be an attack.
__Details__
The Assistant may target a player. They can update this target once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Assistant wants. The Assistant may choose to target nobody, which will stop their power from being used.
When the Assistant is affected by a wolfish player's power, that is not an attack, it will be redirected to the target without the wolfish player being informed. 
The Assistant's redirection power can only be used once per game. The Assistant is informed when their power is used, but they are not told what ability they redirected.

__Simplified__
The Assistant may select a player to redirect one werewolf action to. The action cannot be an attack.
They will be informed when their ability is used.

__Card__
All the mirrors in the Assistant's house may one day help them confuse an unwanted intruder.
