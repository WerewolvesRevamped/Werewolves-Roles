**Macho** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
If attacked, the Macho will be told the name of their attacker and will not die until the end of the next day.
__Details__
If the Macho is attacked during the night, they will survive until the end of the next day. At the end of that day, the Macho dies. 
If it’s a group that attacked the Macho, the attacker’s name is told to the Macho. 
If the Macho is attacked multiple times in a single night, they will not be killed by any of them, and the attacker they are informed of will be chosen randomly.
If the Macho is lynched, they will die as usual. 

__Simplified__
If attacked at night, the Macho will be told the name of one of their attackers and will not die until the end of the next day.
