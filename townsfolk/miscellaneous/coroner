**Coroner** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
Upon every death, the Coroner is informed how that participant died. 
__Details__
The Coroner will be told the cause of death for every dead player; however, if multiple causes of death are present, only a single, arbitrary cause will be revealed to the Coroner. 
The Coroner is told the name of role that killed the player (if applicable) and the type of death (this can be either “attack”, “kill”, “lynch” or “true kill”), as well as the name (but not the role) of the player that died. 
The Coroner is not affected by any disguises.

__Simplified__
Upon every death, the Coroner is informed how that participant died.

__Formalized__
On @All Death:
  • @Attacker is part of @DeadAlive: Learn `@This died by @DeathType from @Attacker->Role`
  • Otherwise: Learn `@This died by @DeathType`

__Card__
The Coroner learns the method of death through thorough autopsy.
