**Stalker** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Each day, starting Day 2, the Stalker may assign two extra invisible votes to a player in the current day’s lynch poll.
__Details__
Each day, starting Day 2, the Stalker may threaten a player. That player will have two more invisible votes against them on the daily lynch poll. If there are multiple lynch polls, it will add invisible votes for that player on all of them. These additional votes are not revealed, instead the threatened player may win the lynch even if they dont have the most votes. The threatened player is not informed that they are threatened. Threatening a player is an immediate day ability.

__Simplified__
Each day, starting Day 2, the Stalker may assign two extra invisible votes to a player in the current day’s lynch poll.

__Formalized__
