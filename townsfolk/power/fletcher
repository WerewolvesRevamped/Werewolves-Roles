**Fletcher** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Fletcher selects a target. Unless the Fletcher changes their mind before they die, their target gains the abilities of a Huntress.
__Details__
The Fletcher must choose a target to be “Fletcher’s Customer” at the start of the game. Their target can not be changed. 
If no target is selected before Night 1, a target is randomly assigned. 
Fletcher’s Customer gains a private channel and may select a target of their own who will be killed if Fletcher’s Customer is killed. 
At any point while the Fletcher is alive, the Fletcher may irreversibly revoke Fletcher’s Customer's abilities. Choosing and revoking a customer are immediate abilities.
