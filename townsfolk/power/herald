**Herald** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
The Herald selects a role and is informed when the last player with that role dies.
__Details__
The Herald may immediately change their target once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Herald wants to. The Herald may choose to not target a role, which will stop their power from being used.
If several players die at the same time the Herald is not informed which of the players had their selected role.
If there are no players of the selected role, or if the last player with the selected role changes to a different role, the Herald is not informed.
The Herald is not affected by any disguises or obstructions.
The Herald may use their power several times.

__Simplified__
The Herald selects a role and is informed when the last player with that role dies. Once that happens, they may select a new role.
