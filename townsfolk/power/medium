**Medium** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Each night, the Medium may ask the dead players one question.
__Details__
During each night, the Medium has access to a second secret channel where they can ask a question; once day starts, the channel is locked and a Yes/No poll is created. All dead participants are able to vote on the poll.
The Medium may only ask one question per night. The question needs to be one simple "yes or no" question without any further or hidden meaning.
Once the day ends, the poll is closed and the Medium gains access to the second secret channel again.

In *haunting* games, the Medium may only ask whether a specific living player "can be trusted". Ghostly players do not learn the Medium's identity. Banished players cannot vote.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Medium may ask the dead players a yes or no question.
The dead players will be able to vote during the day; when day ends the Medium learns the result, but not who voted how.
