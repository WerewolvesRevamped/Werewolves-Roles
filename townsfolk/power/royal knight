**Royal Knight** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Once per game, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch.
__Details__
After Day 1, the Royal Knight may pardon themself from the current or upcoming lynch. If there are several lynches, the Royal Knight's pardon only applies to one of them: they may choose which one.
Pardoning themself causes the Royal Knight to survive the lynch. Pardoning is an immediate ability.
The fact that the Royal Knight was pardoned is not announced, and is indistinguishable from other situations in which the winner of the lynch poll is not lynched.

__Simplified__
After Day 1, the Royal Knight may silently cancel the lynch once.

__Formalized__
Immediate: Protect @Self from `Lynches` through Passive Defense (~NextDay) [Quantity: 1, Temporal: Night 2+]

__Card__
The Royal Knight may grant forgiveness to themself in an act of gross judicial overstep.
