**Royal Knight** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Once per game, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch.
__Details__
After Day 1, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the current or upcoming lynch. If there are several lynches, the Royal Knight may only cancel one of them: they may choose which one.
Cancelling the lynch is an immediate ability. However, the fact that the lynch has been cancelled will only be revealed at the end of the day. 
The Royal Knight also chooses whether they want to be revealed or not. If they choose to be revealed, both their role and name are announced: otherwise, neither is.

__Simplified__
After Day 1, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch once.

__Formalized__
Compound:
  • Immediate: Cancel `Lynch` Poll [Quantity: 1, Temporal: Night 2+]
  • End Day: Announce `Royal Knight @Self cancelled lynch`

__Card__
The Royal Knight may grant forgiveness to someone who would be lynched.
