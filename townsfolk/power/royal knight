**Royal Knight** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Once per game, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch.
__Details__
After Day 1, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the current (or if there is none the next) lynch. If there are several lynches the Royal Knight may only cancel one of them, however they may choose which one.
Cancelling the lynch is an immediate ability. However, the fact that the lynch has been canceled will only be revealed at the end of the day. 
The Royal Knight also receives the choice whether they want to be revealed or not.


__Simplified__
Once per game, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch.
