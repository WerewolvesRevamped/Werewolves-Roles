**Royal Knight** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Once per game, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch.
__Details__
After Day 1, the Royal Knight may cancel the lynch at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the current or upcoming lynch. If there are several lynches, the Royal Knight may only cancel one of them: they may choose which one.
Cancelling the lynch causes the winner to survive the lynch, rather than annulling the results. Cancelling is an immediate ability.
The fact that the lynch has been cancelled is not announced, and is indistinguishable from other situations in which the winner of the lynch poll is not lynched.

__Simplified__
After Day 1, the Royal Knight may silently cancel the lynch once.
