**Exorcist** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Each day, the Exorcist may remove negative effects from one player.
__Details__
Each day, the Exorcist can exorcise one player. Most negative effects caused by solo roles are removed from the player and the Exorcist is informed which effects were removed. Exorcising a player is an immediate effect.
The Exorcist may only exorcise each player once. A player may be exorcised multiple times by different Exorcists. The Exorcist can not undo the consequences of effects, such as a player having turned into an Undead or having joined another channel, but can still remove the effects the player has. 
All the members of the solo team whose effect is cured are informed about this.

_Negative Effects:_
The following effects can be removed by the Exorcist:

Enchanted/Charmed - Flute Team
Powdered - Pyro Team
Demonized - Underworld Team
Contaminated - Plague Team
Doomed - Horsemen Team

__Simplified__
Each day, the Exorcist may exorcise one player, removing effects caused by solo roles from them.
The Exorcist learns which effects were removed, and the solo team whose effect is cured is also informed.
