**Exorcist** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
Each day, the Exorcist may remove negative effects from one player.
__Details__
Each day, the Exorcist can exorcise one player. All negative effects caused by solo roles are removed from the player and the Exorcist is informed which effects were removed. Exorcising a player is an immediate effect.
Players that have already been exorcised can not be exorcised again. The Exorcist can not cure players if they have changed role as the result of an effect, such as the Undead, but can still remove other possible effects the Undead has. 
All the members of the solo team whose effect is cured are informed about this.
__Negative Effects__
The following effects can be removed by the Exorcist:

Enchanted/Charmed - Flute Team
Soulless - Hell Team
Powdered - Pyro Team
Demonized - Underworld Team
Contaminated/Contagious - Plague Team

Sleepless - Nightmare Team
Herded - Flock Team
Doomed - Horsemen Team

__Simplified__
Each day, the Exorcist may exorcise one player, removing effects caused by solo roles from them. Each player can only be exorcised once.
The Exorcist learns which effects were removed, and the solo team whose effect is cured is also informed.
