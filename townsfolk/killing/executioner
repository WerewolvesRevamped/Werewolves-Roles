**Executioner** | Townsfolk Killing
__Basics__
Whenever the Executioner is chosen to be lynched, it will be prevented, and a player chosen by the Executioner will be lynched in their place.
__Details__
The Executioner may target a player. This target can be updated once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Executioner wants to. Targeting a player is an immediate effect. The Executioner may alternatively choose to not target any player. 
If the Executioner would be lynched, their target is lynched instead. If there is no target, nobody is lynched. 
When the Executioner changes the lynch, their role is revealed to all, and the targeted player is lynched immediately. 
This ability will only work once. Future lynches will behave as normal.
