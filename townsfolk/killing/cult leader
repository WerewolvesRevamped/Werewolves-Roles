**Cult Leader** | Townsfolk Killing
__Basics__
The Cult Leader acts as a cult member, except that if the Cult Leader dies the cult loses its ability to attack at night.
__Details__
The Cult Leader is part of the cult. After Night 1, the cult can attack one player each night.
When the Cult Leader dies, the cult is disbanded and can no longer attack at night.
If the Cult Leader loses their role, the cult continues to exist, until the original Cult Leader dies.
Any member of the cult, who no longer is a cult member or Cult Leader, can still vote on who to kill. 
The cult decides their victims by voting on whom they suspect most. The cult’s attack is an end-night ability. 

__Simplified__
The Cult Lember and the cult members have a secret channel where they can communicate among themselves securely.
After Night 1, the cult can vote to attack one player each night. When the Cult Leader dies, the cult is disbanded.
