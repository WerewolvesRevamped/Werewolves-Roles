**Mad Scientist** | Townsfolk Killing
__Basics__
The Mad Scientist has two test subjects, one player from the townsfolk and a werewolf. If killed, their subjects will also die.
__Details__
At the start of the game, the Mad Scientist is assigned two players, called test subjects, with whom they share an additional secret channel. The test subjects do not know the identity of the Mad Scientist.
When the Mad Scientist dies, both of their subjects are attacked by the Mad Scientist. Attacking the other player is an immediate ability.
When the Mad Scientist kills, they are revealed as the Mad Scientist.
Both test subjects are additionally strongly disguised as the Mad Scientist.

__Simplified__
The Mad Scientist has two subjects (townsfolk and werewolf). When the Mad Scientist dies, both subjects are attacked.
