**Mad Scientist** | Townsfolk Killing
__Basics__
The Mad Scientist has two test subjects, from two different teams. If killed, their targeted subject will also die.
__Details__
At the start of the game, the Mad Scientist is assigned two players, called test subjects, with which they share an additional secret channel. The test subjects do not know the identity of the Mad Scientist. They interrogate their subjects and, before the Mad Scientist dies, they must choose one of the two assigned players to take with them to their death.
If the Mad Scientist has not targeted a subject when they die, a random subject will be killed.  
The two subjects always start on two different teams, and never as unaligned.
The Mad Scientist can choose a target, even if the target is already dead. Attacking the other player is an immediate ability.
When the Mad Scientist kills, they are revealed as the Mad Scientist.

__Simplified__
The Mad Scientist has two subjects, from two different teams, one of which they must choose to die with them when they are killed.
