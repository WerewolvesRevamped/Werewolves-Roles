**Baker** | Townsfolk Group
__Basics__
There is always more than one Baker. All the Bakers have a secret channel where they can communicate with the other Bakers securely.
Whenever the wolves kill a Baker, they will be able to use their powers twice.
__Details__
Bakers share a private channel, where they can communicate with each other. 
When the Wolfpack kills a Baker, each member of the pack will be able to use any of their role's powers another time during the next day/night. If a wolfish player kills a Baker, without using the pack's attack, only they will be able to use their power an additional time.
__Edge Cases__
If a Baker loses their role, they will still keep access to the channel. This means that at some point, a Baker may betray the group. 
If a Baker is infected by the infecting wolf their role changes to bloody butcher, instead of wolf. If this happens, all other Bakers become butchers, and are notified of this change. 

__Simplified__
All the Bakers share a secret channel and know each other.
