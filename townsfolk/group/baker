**Baker** | Townsfolk Group
__Basics__
There is always more than one Baker. All the Bakers have a secret channel where they can communicate with the other Bakers securely.
Whenever the wolves kill a Baker for the first time, they will be able to attack twice in the following night.
__Details__
Bakers share a private channel, where they can communicate with each other. 
When the Wolfpack kills a Baker for the first time, they will be able to kill an additional player in the next night.
__Edge Cases__
If a Baker loses their role, they will still keep access to the channel. This means that at some point, a Baker may betray the group. 
If a Baker is infected by the infecting wolf, they will become a bloody butcher rather than a wolf: all other Bakers will become butchers. 

__Simplified__
All the Bakers share a secret channel and know each other.
Whenever the wolves kill a Baker for the first time, they will be able to attack again.
