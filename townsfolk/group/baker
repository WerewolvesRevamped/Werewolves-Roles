**Baker** | Townsfolk Group
__Basics__
There is always more than one Baker. All the Bakers have a secret channel where they can communicate with the other Bakers securely.
__Details__
Bakers are a special type of townsfolk; they know all other players who gained the Baker role. They can fully trust and rely on each other. Bakers share a private channel, where they can communicate with each other. 
If a Baker loses their role, they will still keep access to the channel. This means that at some point, a Baker may betray the group. 
If a Baker is infected by the infecting wolf their role changes to bloody butcher, instead of wolf. If this happens, all other Bakers become butchers, and are notified of this change. 

__Simplified__
All the Bakers share a secret channel and know each other.
