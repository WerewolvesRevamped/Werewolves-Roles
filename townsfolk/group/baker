**Baker** | Townsfolk Group
__Basics__
There is always more than one Baker. All the Bakers have a secret channel where they can communicate with the other Bakers securely.
Whenever the wolves kill a Baker, they will be able to use their powers twice.
__Details__
Bakers share a private channel, where they can communicate with each other. 
When the Wolfpack kills a Baker, each member of the pack will be able to use any of their role's powers an additional time during the next appropriate phase. If a wolfish player kills a Baker in any way other than the pack's attack, only they will be able to use their power an additional time.
__Edge Cases__
If a Baker loses their role, they will still keep access to the channel. This means that at some point, a Baker may betray the group. 
If a Baker is infected by the infecting wolf, they will become a bloody butcher rather than a wolf: all other Bakers will become butchers. 

__Simplified__
All the Bakers share a secret channel and know each other.
Whenever the wolves kill a Baker, they will be able to use their powers twice.
