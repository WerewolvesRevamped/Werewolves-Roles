**Aura Teller** | Townsfolk Investigative 
__Basics__
Each night, the Aura Teller may check a target to determine if they are “a threat” or “not a threat”.
__Details__
The Aura Teller cannot see a player’s role, but they can check whether or not they are a threat. Lycans, and roles classified as killing roles show up as a threat.
The Aura Teller’s inspection is an immediate ability.
Some roles or players may be able to kill, but will not show up as threats as they are neither lycans nor a role classified as a killing role.
The Aura Teller is affected by strong disguises and redirections.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Aura Teller may check a player. Lycans, and roles classified as killing roles show up as a threat, while all other roles are not a threat.
They are affected by strong disguises and redirections.
