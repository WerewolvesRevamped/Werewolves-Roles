<?Wager:ðŸ‘º> You have received the Devil's wager! <?Wager:ðŸ‘º> 

You can decide to either:

1. Attack a player, but sell your soul <?Soul:> in the process.

2. Protect yourself or any player, but sell your soul <?Soul:> in the process.

3. Check someone's role, but the Devil will see the result and also your role.

4. Ignore, and don't do anything.
