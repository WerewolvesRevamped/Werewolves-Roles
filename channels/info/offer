<?CerberusOffer:ðŸ‘º> You have received the Cerberus' offer! <?CerberusOffer:ðŸ‘º> 

You can decide to either:

1. Protect yourself, but sell your soul in the process. Should you get attacked, the Cerberus dies instead and Hell Team learns the role and identity of the attacker. Additionally, the Cerberus will attack your attacker with its last breath.

2. Ignore, and don't do anything.
