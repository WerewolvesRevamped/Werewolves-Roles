<?CerberusOffer:ðŸ‘º> You have received the Cerberus' offer! <?CerberusOffer:ðŸ‘º> 

You can decide to either:

1. Protect yourself, but sell your soul in the process. Should you be attacked and would die, Hell Team learns the role and identity of the attacker and the Cerberus will attack them. The Cerberus will then die in your place.

2. Ignore, and don't do anything.
