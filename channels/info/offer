<?CerberusOffer:ðŸ‘º> You have received the Cerberus' offer! <?CerberusOffer:ðŸ‘º> 

You can decide to either:

1. Protect yourself, but sell your soul in the process. Should you get attacked, Hell Team learns the role and identity of the attacker and the Cerberus will attack them. The Cerberus will then die.

2. Ignore, and don't do anything.
