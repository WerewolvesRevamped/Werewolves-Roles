<?Baker:🍞> **Bakers** <?Baker:🍞> 

The Bakers is a trusted townsfolk group containing all the bakers and nobody else. Should a baker turn into a wolf, all the bakers turn into butchers, however if a baker betrays the group in any other way, the other bakers will not know.
Whenever the wolves kill a Baker, they will be able to use their powers twice.
