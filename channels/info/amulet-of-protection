<?Amulet:ðŸ“¿> **Amulet of Protection** <?Amulet:ðŸ“¿>

You are the current holder of the *Amulet of Protection*. 
As long as you hold the amulet, you cannot die during the night, but you must pass it to another player during the day.
You may specify up to three players (either at once or separately) and the amulet will be passed to the first player who has not previously had the amulet.
Selecting a target is an immediate effect and should the selection fail you are immediately informed, however passing the amulet is an end-day ability. 
If you fail to select a valid target, the amulet shatters, killing you at the end of the day.
Holders of the amulet do not know who gave them the amulet, nor do they know who has previously held it.
