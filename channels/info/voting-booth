📝 📩 **Voting Booth** <?Mayor:🎩> ☠ 

Each day all participants vote to lynch (kill) one player in this channel. Additionally, players are elected to the titles of Mayor, Reporter and Guardian in that order, as long as there are participants with the previous titles left. That means on the first day a Mayor is elected, and if he survives the night, a Reporter is elected on the next day.
