**Wolfpack** | Werewolf Team Group
__Basics__
The wolfpack is a group consisting out of most (but not all) werewolf roles. Each night, the wolfpack votes to attack one player. Most members of the wolfpack are lycans. The wolfpack may also contain traitors. Some other roles may be in the wolfpack as well if they started out as a member of the wolfpack and then transformed into another role.
