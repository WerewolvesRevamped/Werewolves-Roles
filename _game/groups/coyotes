**Coyotes** | Werewolf Team Group
__Basics__
The Coyotes are a secondary wolf group, containing at least one greater coyote. The Coyotes and the wolfpack do not know each other, but they have the same alignment. If the wolfpack fails to kill a townsfolk player, the Coyotes can attack a player in the next night. 
If there are no living greater coyotes, the Coyotes are disbanded, and they join the wolfpack instead.
