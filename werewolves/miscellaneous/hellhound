**Hellhound** | Werewolf Miscellaneous
__Basics__
There is always more than one Hellhound. All the Hellhounds have a secret channel where they can communicate with the other Hellhounds securely.
__Details__
Hellhounds are the werewolf version of bakers.
These werewolves know from each other that they are Hellhounds, and they can use and share this information in their battle against the white werewolf.
Sometimes it is, and sometimes it is not, in the interest of the werewolf team to immediately inform the rest of the werewolves that they are Hellhounds.
