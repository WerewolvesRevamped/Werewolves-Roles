**Wolf Cub** | Werewolf Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The night after the Wolf Cub dies, the wolfpack will be able to attack an additional player.
__Details__
Whenever a Wolf Cub dies, the other wolfpack members will be able to attack an additional player the night after the Wolf Cub's death. They are allowed to attack the same player several times, if they like. 
This ability is triggered when a player who at any point had the role of Wolf Cub dies, not when a Wolf Cub loses their role.

__Simplified__
The night after the Wolf Cub dies, the wolfpack will be able to kill an additional player.
