**Recluse** | Werewolf Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Recluse is immediately notified of all powers used on them. When a member of the werewolf team uses a power on them, they are given that werewolf's identity.
__Details__
The Recluse is told which role targeted them and what power was used on them, but not the identity of the player that used a power on them. An exception are members of the werewolf team - when they use a power on the Recluse, the Recluse is told the identity of that player as well. When a player uses a power from an extra role on a Recluse, the Recluse sees the extra role, not the player's main role (but they still also see the player's identity for werewolf team members).
The Recluse is not a lycan and is not part of the wolfpack.
Should a wolfish player attempt to attack the Recluse, the attack fails.

__Simplified__
The Recluse and the wolfpack do not know each other.
The Recluse is immediately notified of all powers used on them. When a werewolf uses a power on them, they are given that werewolf's identity.
