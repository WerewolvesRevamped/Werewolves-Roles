**Direwolf** | Werewolf Killing
__Basics__
The Direwolf may attack two people every night if they are the last player left in the pack.
__Details__
If, at the start of the night, the Direwolf is the last remaining member of the wolfpack, they may attack an additional player in addition to the normal wolfpack poll.
Usually, this means the Direwolf will be able to attack two people, but in some situations the amount of attacks and the attacker may also be influenced by other roles/abilities.

__Simplified__
The Direwolf may attack two people every night if they are the last player left in the pack.
