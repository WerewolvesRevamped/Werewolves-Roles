**Tanner** | Werewolf Investigative
__Basics__
Each day, the Tanner may disguise up to two players as roles of the Tanner’s choosing. Each night, the Tanner learns how many living players currently disguised by them are in the wolfpack.
__Details__
Each day, the Tanner can *weakly disguise* up to two players, this can include the Tanner themself.
Disguising players is an *immediate effect*. 
At the start of every night, if there is a living player disguised by the Tanner who is part of the wolfpack, the Tanner is informed by the Hosts that “At least one living player currently tanned by you is a part of the wolfpack.”. 
If the Tanner dies, the assigned players will keep their disguises for the night. All players lose this disguise at the end of the night or upon death.
The Tanner is not a lycan, is not part of the wolfpack, and is not affected by strong disguises.

__Simplified__
The Tanner and the wolfpack do not know each other.
Each day, the Tanner may weakly disguise up to two players as any role.
At the beginning of each night, the Tanner is informed if any living players currently disguised by them are in the wolfpack.
