**Clairvoyant Fox** | Werewolf Investigative
__Basics__
Each day, the Clairvoyant Fox may investigate one player, and the results will be known to both them and the Wolfpack. Once per game, the Clairvoyant Fox may alternatively join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
__Details__
When the Clairvoyant Fox investigates a player, they see that player's role. If the Clairvoyant Fox survives the day, the result of the investigation is also announced to the wolfpack at the start of the night. The wolfpack only sees the result and that it is from a Clairvoyant Fox - they don't know who was checked.
The Clairvoyant Fox is neither a lycan, nor a member of the wolfpack. 
If the Clairvoyant Fox chooses to join the wolfpack, they may not investigate that day, and will lose their power as they will become a regular wolf. 
Joining the wolfpack and investigating a player are immediate abilities.
The investigation is affected by weak disguises, redirections, and obstructions.

__Simplified__
The Clairvoyant Fox and the wolfpack do not know each other.
Each day, the Clairvoyant Fox may investigate one player. This is affected by weak disguises, redirections, and obstructions. At the end of the day the wolfpack is also told the role of that player, but they won't know which player was checked.
Once per game, the Clairvoyant Fox may alternatively give up their power and join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
