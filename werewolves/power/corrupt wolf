**Corrupt Wolf** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
The Corrupt Wolf can manipulate a player's votes in the next day's public polls.
__Details__
Each night, the Corrupt Wolf may select a player and a number of votes (-1, 0, 1, or 2). The next day, the selected player has the chosen vote value instead of their usual value. 
The number of votes replaces the player's vote, it is not additive. However, special votes, like the Mayor's vote, are not affected.
Manipulating a vote is immediate. The Corrupt Wolf may manipulate a member of the wolfpack. The Corrupt Wolf may communicate with their chosen player in a whispers channel until the start of the following night.
The Corrupt Wolf is a lycan and also part of the pack.
The Corrupt Wolf is not affected by redirections.

__Simplified__
The Corrupt Wolf can manipulate a player's votes in the next day's public polls, changing their number of votes to a value within the range of -1 to 2.
Additionally, the Corrupt Wolf can anonymously talk to their target.
