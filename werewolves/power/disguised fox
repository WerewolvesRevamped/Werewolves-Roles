**Disguised Fox** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__
Each day, the Disguised Fox may select a disguise, and the disguise will be announced to the Wolfpack. Once per game, the Disguised Fox may alternatively join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
__Details__
Each day, the Disguised Fox may either select a disguise or choose to join the wolfpack. 
If the Disguised Fox does not select a disguise, they will be disguised as a citizen. The Disguised Fox's disguise is a strong disguise. 
If the Disguised Fox survives the day, the wolfpack is informed at the start of the night that a Disguised Fox has chosen a disguise and what the disguise is. The Disguised Fox's disguise wears off at the end of each night. 
The Disguised Fox is neither a lycan, nor a member of the wolfpack. 
If the Disguised Fox chooses to join the wolfpack, they may not select a disguise for that night, and will lose their power as they will become a regular wolf. 
Joining the wolfpack and selecting a disguise are immediate abilities.

__Simplified__
The Disguised Fox and the wolfpack do not know each other.
Each day, the Disguised Fox may strongly disguise themselves for the following night. At the end of the day, the wolfpack are told which disguise was chosen.
Once per game, the Disguised Fox may alternatively give up their power and join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
