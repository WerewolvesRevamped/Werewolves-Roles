**Reaper* | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team | Haunted
__Basics__
Every other night, the Reaper may banish one ghost, stealing their powers in the process.
__Details__
The Reaper cannot banish on consecutive nights. If the Reaper chooses not to banish, they will once again have the option to banish in the following night.
When the Reaper banishes a player, they gain the player's role as an extra role. If the gained role had abilities with limited uses, the Reaper regains all uses once obtained.
Banishing is an end-night ability.
The Reaper wins when they are the last player alive.
When the Reaper dies, they do not become a ghost: they are immediately banished.
