**Reaper** | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team | Haunted
__Basics__
Every other night, the Reaper may banish one ghost, stealing their powers in the process.
__Details__
The Reaper cannot banish on consecutive nights. If the Reaper chooses not to banish, they will once again have the option to banish in the following night.
When the Reaper banishes a player, they gain the player's role as an extra role. If the gained role had abilities with limited uses, the Reaper regains all uses once obtained.
Banishing is an end-night ability. The Reaper cannot make use of role changing or group joining abilities.
The Reaper is a member of the nightmare team and purgatory channel. The nightmare team wins when all other players are dead or unaligned.
When the Reaper dies, they do not become a ghost: they are immediately banished.

The Reaper wins when it is the last player alive.
