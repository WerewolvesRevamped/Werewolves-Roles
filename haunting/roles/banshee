**Banshee** | Extra Elected | Haunted
__Basics__
Each night, the Banshee may select one living player to haunt for the remainder of the night, preventing them from using any active (or reactive) abilities. 
__Details__
The Banshee may choose to resign at any point during a phase, but will only lose the role at the end of the phase.
Choosing a player to haunt is an immediate action. 
A player can only be haunted once. 
The Banshee is elected in the first ghost election with a revenant, a poltergeist, and no Banshee.
The Banshee gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Banshees.

__Simplified__
The Banshee is elected after the revenant and the poltergeist.
They may decide to haunt a player, preventing them from using any active (or reactive) abilities.
