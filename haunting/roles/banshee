**Banshee** | Extra Elected | Haunted
__Basics__
Each night, the Banshee may select one living player to haunt for the remainder of the night, preventing them from using any active (or reactive) abilities. 
__Details__
The Banshee may choose to resign at any point during a phase, but will only lose the role at the end of the phase.
Choosing a player to haunt is an immediate action. 
The Banshee may not choose to ability block the same player twice.
The Banshee is elected in the first ghost election in which a Revenant and a Poltergeist already exist.
The Banshee gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Banshees.

The Banshee is elected after the revenant and the poltergeist.
They may decide to haunt a player, preventing them from using any active (or reactive) abilities.
