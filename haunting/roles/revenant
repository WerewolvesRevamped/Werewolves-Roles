**Revenant** | Extra Elected | Haunted
__Basics__
Each day, the Revenant may decide whether a banishment will take place during the next night. There may not be banishments in successive nights. 
__Details__
The Revenant may choose to resign at any point during a phase, but will only lose the role at the end of the phase.
Choosing a banishment is an immediate action. 
The Revenant gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Revenants.

__Simplified__
The Revenant is elected before the poltergeist and the banshee.
They may decide whether a banishment will take place, but may not decide on banishments on successive  days.

__Formalized__
Ghostly Role

End Phase: {Vanishing} |silent:granting.resign|
  • Announce `@Self resigned as Revenant`
  • Revoke @ThisAttr from @Self

__Card__
The Revenant is elected to lead the graveyard.
