**Prophet** | Extra Elected | Haunted
__Basics__
The Prophet may perform two miracles - the miracle of protection and the miracle of resurrection - once each.
__Details__
The Prophet is a replacement for the Guardian in *haunting* games and is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor and Gravekeeper, but no living Prophet.
During the night the Prophet can perform the miracle of resurrection or the miracle of protection. The Prophet can only perform one miracle during a night. Peforming a miracle is an end night action, but miracles take effect before end night attacks and banishments.
The Prophet can perform each miracle once. These limitations carry over to future elected Prophets.
The miracle of protection protects the targeted player from all attacks.
The miracle of resurrection transforms the targeted ghostly player back into a living player.
Miracles are announced in story time. The type of miracle performed, but not the target, is announced.
The Prophet may choose to resign at any point during a phase, but will only lose the role at the end of the phase.
The Prophet is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor, a living Gravekeeper and no living Prophet.
The Prophet gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Prophets.

__Simplified__
The Prophet may perform the miracle of resurrection and the miracle of protection once each. They can perform only one miracle in a given night.
Performing a miracle is an end night action that is announced in story time.
The Prophet is elected on the first full day with a living Mayor and Gravekeeper, but no living Prophet.
