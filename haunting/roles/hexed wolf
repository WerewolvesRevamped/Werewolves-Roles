**Hexed Wolf** | Werewolf Investigative | Haunted
__Basics__
The Hexed Wolf may learn the roles of those who lynched it, and send that info back to the wolfpack.
__Details__
Everyone who lynches a Hexed Wolf will be hexed. While the Hexed Wolf is a ghost, at night it may investigate a hexed player to learn their role. It is affected by weak disguises.
Afterwards the Hexed Wolf will send the identity of a hexed player to wolfpack. The wolfpack will learn both the player and the role they were investigated as. The role sent back can be the same or different than the one it investigated earlier.
Both of these are immediate actions.
The Hexed Wolf is a member of the wolfpack and a lycan.
