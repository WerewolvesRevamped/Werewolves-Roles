**Hexed Wolf** | Werewolf Investigative | Haunted
__Basics__
The Hexed Wolf may learn the roles of those who lynched them and send that info back to the wolfpack.
__Details__
Everyone who lynches a Hexed Wolf will be hexed. During the night, while the Hexed Wolf is a ghost, they may investigate a hexed player to learn their role. This is affected by all disguises.
The Hexed Wolf may also send the role and identity of a hexed player to the wolfpack. The Hexed Wolf investigates the player, but receives no result; the wolfpack will learn both the player and the role.
Both of the Hexed Wolf's investigations are immediate abilities.
The Hexed Wolf is a member of the wolfpack and a lycan.

__Simplified__

The Hexed Wolf may also send the role and identity of a hexed player to wolfpack. The wolfpack will learn both the player and the role they were investigated as.
