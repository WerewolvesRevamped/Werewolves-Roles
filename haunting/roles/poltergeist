**Poltergeist** | Extra Elected | Haunted
__Basics__
Each night, the Poltergeist may decide whether to haunt the tavern.
__Details__
The Poltergeist may choose to resign at any point during a phase, but will only lose the role at the end of the phase.
Choosing to haunt the tavern is an immediate ability. If the Poltergeist chooses to haunt the tavern, the tavern channel will be locked and it will be announced that the tavern is haunted.
Each ghostly player may send a single anonymous message to the tavern.
Once the night ends, the haunting ends and the tavern will be unlocked.
Whilst the Poltergeist is haunting the tavern, it is *absent* and will evade banishments (excluding the nightly banishment poll).
Other roles that spend their night at the tavern (i.e., Alcoholic) must stay at home while the Poltergeist is haunting and are thus *not* absent.
The Poltergeist is elected in the first ghost election in which a Revenant already exists.
The Poltergeist gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Poltergeists.

__Simplified__
The Poltergeist is elected before the banshee, but after the revenant.
They may decide whether to haunt the tavern at night, protecting themselves from banishments and passing info to the living players.
