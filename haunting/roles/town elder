**Town Elder** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous | Haunted
__Basics__
The Town Elder will survive the first night attack against them. But a second attempt, causes them to die of old age instead, thus they are banished witout becoming a ghost first.
__Details__
The Town Elder will not be notified of their defense being used.
If the Town Elder is killed in any way after surving a night attack, they immediately are banished.
If the Town Elder dies *before* using their defense (i.e. lynching or day kill), then they will become a ghost as normal.

__Simplified__
The Town Elder will survive the first night attack against them, but when killed a second time they become banished witout becoming a ghost first.

__Formalized__
Starting: Protect @Self from `Attacks` through Partial Defense during Night (~UntilUse)
