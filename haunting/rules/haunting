**Haunting** | Haunting Information
__Basics__
Haunting is a gamemode in which you still play after dying.
__Details__
Players that die, turn into ghosts (`$i ghost`) instead of completely dying.
Ghosts can no longer talk in the normal channels, but can interact with other ghosts in a graveyard channel and through ccs.
Ghosts have their own elections (`$i ghost elections`) and a lynch equivalent (`$i banishment`), however banishment only occurs when so decreed by an elected role.
When a ghost is banished, they are fully eliminated and no longer participate in the game.
In the Haunting gamemode, the reporter role is replaced by the gravekeeper (`$i gravekeeper`).
