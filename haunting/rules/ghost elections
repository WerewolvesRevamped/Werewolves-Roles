**Ghost Elections** | Haunting Information
__Basics__
Similiarly to the living, the ghosts have three elections.
__Details__
The three elected ghost roles are: Revenant, Poltergeist, Banshee.
Each of these roles is elected when all previous positions are occupied.
Unlike the elections of the living, the elections of the ghosts occur at night.
Additionally, the ghost elections only occur when there are two or more ghosts.
