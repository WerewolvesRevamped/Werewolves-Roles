**Death** | Haunting Information
__Basics__
In Haunting, death is not the end. When a player dies, they turn into a Ghost.
__Details__
Ghosts retain access to all their channels, but can no longer write in any of them (except for their own personal secret channel), however they gain access to a graveyard channel with all the other ghosts.
Ghosts can still make new CCs, but only with other ghosts.
Ghosts have their own polls which are invisible to the living, however their results are announced to everyone in story time.
Usually, ghosts may not use their role abilities anymore (unless specified otherwise).
