**Death & Banishment** | Haunting Information
__Death__
In Haunting, death is not the end. When a player dies, they turn into a Ghost.
Ghosts retain access to all their channels, but can no longer write in any of them (except for their own personal secret channel), however they gain access to a graveyard channel with all the other ghosts.
Ghosts can still make new CCs, but only with other ghosts.
Ghosts have their own polls which are invisible to the living, however their results are announced to everyone in story time.

__Banishment__
Based on the decisions of the Banisher elected role, there may be a nightly banishment poll, in which a ghost can be banished by the other ghosts.
When a ghost is banished, they become a dead participant and are completely eliminated from the game.
Some roles may additionally also be able to banish ghosts.
Banishment is the ghost's equivalent of killing.
