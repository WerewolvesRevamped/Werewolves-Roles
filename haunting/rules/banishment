**Banishment** | Haunting Information
__Basics__
Banishment is the ghosts' equivalent of dying.
__Details__
When a ghost is banished, they become a dead participant and are completely eliminated from the game.
Banishments often occur as the result of daily polls created by a revenant. Some roles are able to banish ghosts by other means.
Defenses against attacks do not apply to banishments.
