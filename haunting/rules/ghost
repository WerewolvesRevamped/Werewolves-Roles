**Ghost** | Haunting Information
__Basics__
A ghost is a player who has died, but is still playing. Their abilities to interact with the living players are limited, but unlike dead participants they are not completely eliminated.
__Details__
Ghosts retain access to their original channels, but cannot write messages in them anymore (except for their own personal secret channel).
By default, ghosts cannot use their role abilities anymore (unless specified otherwise). There are special roles that may use their abilities when ghostly, and additionally, the `Ghostly` and `Haunted` modifiers allow ghostly players to use their abilities as well.
Ghosts can talk to each other in the graveyard and create new CCs with each other, but not with the living players.
