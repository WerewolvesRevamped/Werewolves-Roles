**Ghostly** | Attribute
__Basics__
A Ghostly player may not use any of their abilities while alive; instead, they can use them while they are a ghost.
This does not affect which players they can target, so for most roles they may only target living players even while they are a ghost.

__Formalized__
Haunted Attribute
Starting: Activate @Self while `Ghostly`
