**Souls**
Members of the hell team that can use Souls - soul-users - may use a Soul to protect someone from all attacks for the current night. If used in this way during a day phase, the player will be protected during the following night phase.
Using a Soul to protect a player is an end phase effect.

Soul-users may use a Soul to attack a player. The player will be attacked at the end of the phase. If the attacked player is soulless or a part of the hell team, the attack silently fails. The method of their death is not revealed (except to coroners). 
This ability may be used during both day and night phases.

If a soul-user is attacked during the night and there is a Soul in the pool, the soul-user will be protected and a Soul will be consumed automatically. A Soul is consumed for every attack against a soul-user.
If several soul-users are attacked simultaneously and not enough Souls remain in the pool to protect from each attack, the devil has priority of protection. If any Souls remain in the pool after this, subsequent protections occur in random order.
When souls are used in an automatic protection, all members of the hell team are informed of who was attacked.
