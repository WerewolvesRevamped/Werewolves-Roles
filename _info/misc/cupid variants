**Cupid Variants**
__Details__
The cupid can never change role to a role that isn't a Cupid Variant. Every time the cupid would usually change role, they instead change to a different Cupid Variant. After picking a lover, or if the lover changes alignment, the cupid may also change role. The following Cupid Variants exist.

__Cupid__
This is the default cupid role, and the only one that can be in a role list. Unless another case applies, the cupid stays as this role.

__Cupid Wolf__
If the cupid is targetted by the infecting wolf, they turn into a cupid wolf instead of a normal wolf.

__Undead Cupid__
If the cupid is demonized and then killed, they turn into an undead cupid instead of into an undead.

__Demonic Cupid__
If the cupid's lover is a member of the hell team, the cupid becomes a demonic cupid and a full member of hell. Afterwards, the cupid cannot change role again.
