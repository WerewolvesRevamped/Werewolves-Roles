<?Baker:🍞> **Bakers** <?Baker:🍞> 

The Bakers is a trusted townsfolk group containing all the bakers and nobody else. Should a baker turn into a wolf, all the bakers turn into butchers. If a baker betrays the group in any other way, the other bakers will not know.
When the wolfpack kills a baker for the first time, they will be able to attack an additional time during the next night.
