<?Baker:🍞> **Bakers** <?Baker:🍞> 

The Bakers is a trusted townsfolk group containing all the Bakers and nobody else. Should a baker turn into a wolf, all the Bakers turn into butchers. If a baker betrays the group in any other way, the other Bakers will not know.
Whenever the wolfpack kills a baker for the first time, they will be able to attack an additional time in the next night.
