**Chef** | Unaligned Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Chef can choose to make charmed food or poisoned food each night, and select a customer. The following day, the customer can decide to eat the food, and, depending on the food, gain invulnerability for the night or die. The Chef wins if they are alive at the end of the game, and at least one waiter remains.
__Details__
At the beginning of each day, the customer chosen by the Chef is given the opportunity to eat the food. They can choose yes or no, but they don’t know what food the Chef sent them. If they eat the poisoned food, they die at the end of the day. If they eat the charmed food, they are invulnerable from night attacks for the next night. After the night ends, the effect of the charmed food disappears. 
Making food and selecting a customer is an end-night ability. Eating the food is an end-day ability.
Once a customer has eaten food, they can no longer be sent food.
Each game has a certain amount of players that are “waiters”, they are not informed about this, nor does it affect their win condition or ability. The waiters are on different teams. The Chef wins, if at least one waiter, and the Chef itself are alive when the game ends. The Chef is able to win with any team, even if that teams win condition is to kill all others.
The Chef dies once they are unable to win; this usually happens when the last waiter dies.
