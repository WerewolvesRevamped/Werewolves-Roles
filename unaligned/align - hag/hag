**Hag** | Unaligned Align | Limited
__Basics__
The Hag can win with any team, unless that team has wronged the hags. The Hag will turn into a specific type of hag at the end of the day.
__Details__
The Hag is one of the hags (`$i hags`).
At the start of the game, the Hag may name one other hag role. 
At the end of the day the Hag turns into one of the other hag roles, however they can not become the one they named nor can they immediately become a bitter hag.
If the Hag doesn't choose they can turn into any of the other hag roles (except bitter hag).
The Hag does not have a spell at the start of the game, but gains one later, as they turn into another hag role.
