**Hag** | Unaligned Align | Limited
__Basics__
The Hag will turn into a specific type of hag at the end of the day.
__Details__
The Hag is one of the hags (`$i hags`).
The hags can win with any team, unless that team has wronged the coven: however, they cannot win if the coven has never been wronged.
At the start of the game, the Hag may discard one hag role (vicious, cautious or prophetic). 
At the end of the day, the Hag turns into an undiscarded hag role and becomes the coven-aligned.
The Hag does not have a spell at the start of the game, but gains one once they turn into another hag role.

__Simplified__
The Hag can win with any team, unless that team has wronged the coven, but cannot win if they have never been wronged.
The Hag will turn into a specific type of hag at the end of the day.
