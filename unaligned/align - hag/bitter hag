**Bitter Hag** | Solo Killing - Coven Team | Limited Transformation
__Basics__
If the hags have been wronged by all remaining teams, they turn into Bitter Hags. The Bitter Hag wins if all remaining players are dead, unaligned, or coven-aligned. The Bitter Hag may use each of the hag spells every night.
__Details__
When hags become Bitter Hags, they gain a new secret channel with any other Bitter Hags. Each Bitter Hag may protect, investigate and attack a player every night. Any remaining spells prior to becoming Bitter Hag are not preserved.
The spells of the Bitter Hag work like the spells of the cautious, vicious and prophetic hags and are not affected by any disguises, redirections or obstructions.
The Bitter Hag cannot be part of role lists and can only be created by a hag becoming one.
The Bitter Hag is strongly disguised as a Hag.
The Bitter Hag is coven-aligned.

__Simplified__
If the hags have been wronged by all remaining teams, they turn into Bitter Hags. The Bitter Hag wins if all remaining players are dead, unaligned or hags. Each Bitter Hag may protect, investigate and attack a player once per night.
