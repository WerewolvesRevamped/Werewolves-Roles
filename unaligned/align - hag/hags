**The Hags** | Additional Information
The Hags win if they're alive at the end of the game and have been wronged at least once, as long as the winning team didn't wrong them. At the start of the game, the Hags cannot win, but if a team wrongs the Hags, the Hags can win with any team except the one that has wronged them. The Hags do not know each other, but always have the same win condition and alignment. If the Hags are wronged it is announced which team has wronged the Hags, even if no Hags are left. If all remaining teams have wronged the Hags, all remaining Hags turn into bitter hags.

If a Hag is attacked, killed, has their role changed or has their role publicly revealed the team of the player responsible has wronged the Hags. If a Hag is lynched the team(s) which had the most votes on the lynched Hag has wronged the Hags. If a Hag is lynched by unusual means, the team of the player responsible has wronged the Hags. If a player applies a solo team effect to a Hag, that player's team has wronged the Hags. Unaligned players cannot wrong the hags.

Each Hag (with the exception of the plain Hag) has one specific spell, that they can use during the night. Hags may only use their spell once, however every time a Hag is wronged they gain an additional use for their spell. Hags are allowed to wait until their spell has several uses and then use it more than once in one night.

At the start of the game the Hags don't have an alignment, and cannot win, but as soon as they are wronged for the first time a new hag alignment is formed. Teams that have *not* wronged the Hags can still win together with the Hags, according to the standard Unaligned rules, however teams that have wronged the Hags need them dead in order to win. 

If a cupid falls in love with a hag and the cupid is attacked, killed or lynched, the hags are wronged as if the cupid was a hag, other forms of wronging however do not apply.

Use `$i uah` for a list of all hags.
