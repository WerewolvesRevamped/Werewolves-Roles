**Dog** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Dog must choose to align with either the townsfolk or the werewolves. During later nights, they may check one player's role.
__Details__
If the Dog hasnâ€™t chosen before the night ends, they will align with the townsfolk.
After Night 1, the Dog can inspect a player each night. The Dog will be told what their role is.
Choosing a team to align with and inspecting a player are immediate abilities. The Dog is affected by weak disguises and redirections.
The Dog is nonaligned until it aligns with a team.

__Simplified__
During Night 1, the Dog must choose to align with either town or wolves. During later nights, they may check one player's role.
