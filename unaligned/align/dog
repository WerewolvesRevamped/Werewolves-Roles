**Dog** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Dog may choose between fortune teller, warlock or psychopath, and will immediately become this role for the rest of the game.
__Details__
Choosing a role is an immediate ability. If the Dog hasnâ€™t chosen a role before the night ends, the dog will become a Fortune Teller. After choosing a role the Dog is no longer unaligned.
If there is also a cat in game the Dog will become rival instead of psychopath.
The Dog is strongly disguised as Dog, this will persist through role changes.

__Simplified__
During Night 1, the Dog may choose between fortune teller, warlock or psychopath, and will immediately become this role for the rest of the game.
