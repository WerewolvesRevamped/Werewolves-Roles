**Dog** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Dog must choose to immediately become either a fortune teller, a warlock, or a specific unaligned role.
__Details__
Choosing a role is an immediate ability. If the Dog hasnâ€™t chosen a role before the night ends, they will become a Fortune Teller.
If there is a cat corresponding to the Dog, the unaligned role the Dog may become is rival - otherwise, it is psychopath.
A Dog which becomes a fortune teller or a warlock may not use that role's investigation during Night 1.
The Dog is strongly disguised as Dog: this persists despite role changes.

__Simplified__
During Night 1, the Dog may choose between fortune teller, warlock, and either rival or psychopath. It will immediately become this role for the rest of the game.
