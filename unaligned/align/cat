**Cat** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Cat will become the counter-role to that which the dog has chosen. 
__Details__
If the dog chooses fortune teller, the Cat will turn into warlock, and vice versa. The dog choosing rival will turn the Cat into an opposing rival.
Changing role is an immediate consequence of the dog choosing. A Cat which becomes a fortune teller or a warlock may not use that role's investigation during Night 1.
For each Cat in the game, there must be a corresponding dog. Neither player will know their counterpart.
The Cat is strongly disguised as Cat: this will persist despite any role changes.
The Cat is nonaligned until it changes role.

__Simplified__
For each Cat, there is a corresponding dog. The Cat will become the opposite of the role the dog chose.
