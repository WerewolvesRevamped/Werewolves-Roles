**Cat** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Cat will align with the opposite team to that which the dog has chosen. During later nights, they may check one player's role.
__Details__
If the dog chooses to align with the townsfolk, the Cat will align with the werewolves, and vice versa. If the dog changed role before choosing an alignment, the Cat will align with the townsfolk at the end of night 1.
Changing alignment is an immediate consequence of the dog choosing. 
For each Cat in the game, there must be a corresponding dog. Neither player will know their counterpart.
After Night 1, the Cat can inspect a player each night. The Cat will be told what their role is.
Inspecting a player is an immediate ability. The Cat is affected by weak disguises and redirections.
The Cat is nonaligned until it aligns with a team.

__Simplified__
For each Cat, there is a corresponding dog. The Cat will align with the opposite team to that which the dog chose.
