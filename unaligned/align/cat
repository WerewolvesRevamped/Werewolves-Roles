**Cat** | Unaligned Align
__Basics__
During Night 1, the Cat will become the role that counters the role that dog has chosen for the rest of the game. 
__Details__
If the dog chooses fortune teller, the Cat will turn into warlock; warlock will turn the Cat into a fortune teller; and rival will turn the Cat into an opposing rival.
Changing role is an immediate consequence of the dog choosing.
For each Cat in the game, there must be a corresponding dog. Neither the Cat, nor the dog will know their counterpart.
The Cat is strongly disguised as Cat, this will persist through role changes.

__Simplified__
For each Cat, there is a corresponding dog. The Cat will become the opposite of the role the dog chose.
