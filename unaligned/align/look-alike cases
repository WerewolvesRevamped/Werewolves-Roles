**Look-Alike Special Cases**
By default the Look-Alike simply copies the role of the other player. In many cases the Look-Alike doesn't just copy the role, but also joins the channels of the copied role.
If a role that is part of a group is copied the Look-Alike always joins the group channels. For roles listed as 'Join' the Look-Alike additionally also joins the private secret channel.
When a Look-Alike joins the private secret channel of another player, their actions are turned into polls, which also turns immediate abilities into end abilities.
For roles listed as 'Special Copy' the Look-Alike instead turns into the listed role, instead of the copied one.
