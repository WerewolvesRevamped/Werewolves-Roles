**Cupid Alignment Examples** 
Since it can be difficult to figure out the exact win condition of the cupid couple, here is a list of examples. For each couple a list of players that may remain alive is provided, unless everyone else must die, it can always implicitly be assumed that the couple can remain alive, without needing to meet any other conditions. For all couples Unaligned players may remain alive, so Unaligned is never listed.
If a Cupid changes role into another alignment and is in love with an unaligned player, instead of their win conditions being combined, the couple has two possible win conditions and may win with either. If the lover ascends, so does the Cupid. In couples with an Unaligned player, the secondary unaligned win condition is not listed. Some couples have ”Any” as the lover, this means this case applies for any alignment not previously listed.
