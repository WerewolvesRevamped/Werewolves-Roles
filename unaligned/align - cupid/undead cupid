**Undead Cupid** | Unaligned Align - Underworld Base Alignment | Transformation
__Basics__
The Undead Cupid is a cupid that has been demonized and then killed.
__Details__
Instead of turning into an undead, the cupid turns into an Undead Cupid. 
The Undead Cupid works like the cupid, with one exception: The Undead Cupid's base alignment is underworld.
If the lover is part of a different alignment, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is Undead Cupid and a werewolf, everyone else must die. If the lover is also part of the underworld alignment, they are underworld aligned and can win together with them. 
If the lover is unaligned, the couple can either win with the underworld team or with the lover's win condition.

__Simplified__
The Undead Cupid is a cupid that has been demonized and then killed. The Undead Cupid's base alignment is underworld.
