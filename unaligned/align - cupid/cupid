**Cupid** | Unaligned Align - Townsfolk Base Alignment
__Basics__
The Cupid chooses one player to be their lover, and forms an inseparable team with that player.
__Details__
During Night 1, the Cupid must choose one player to become their lover. If the Cupid does not choose in time, they will fall in love with a random player. The lover is added to the Cupid’s secret channel and the lover's role is revealed to the Cupid.
The Cupid and their lover form an inseparable team; they will die if the other player dies. When this happens it is announced. Choosing a lover is an immediate ability.
The Cupid will gain the same alignment as their lover, however if the Cupid or their lover changes alignment then the Cupid and their lover form a new win condition based on a combination of the win conditions.
If the Cupid's lover is unaligned they can only win with their lover's win condition.
The Cupid’s love overrides any other mechanic that may cause a player to change teams for any reason; the Cupid is always on the same team as their lover. 
After choosing a lover, unless they are also unaligned, the Cupid is no longer unaligned.
If the Cupid loses their role before selecting a lover, a random lover is chosen.
The Cupid can never change role to anything but another cupid variant (more info in `$info cupid variants`).
If the Cupid's lover is solo then the Cupid is immune to that team's effects or their consiquences (e.g powdering, death by plague, sleepless, ect)

__Simplified__
The Cupid chooses one player to become their lover. They can never betray each other and if one dies, the other does too. The Cupid's base alignment is the same as their lover's origional alignment.
If their lover is of a different alignment, they must fulfill both win conditions, usually meaning they must kill everyone else, leaving only the couple.
