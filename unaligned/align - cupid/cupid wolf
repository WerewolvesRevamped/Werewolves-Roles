**Cupid Wolf** | Unaligned Align - Werewolf Base Alignment | Transformation
__Basics__
The Cupid Wolf is a cupid that has been infected by the infected wolf.
__Details__
If turned into a wolf in any way, the cupid turns into an Cupid Wolf instead. 
The Cupid Wolf works like the cupid, with one exception: The Cupid Wolf's base alignment is werewolf.
If the lover is part of a different alignment, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is Cupid Wolf and a citizen, everyone else must die. If the lover is also part of the werewolf alignment, they are werewolf aligned and can win together with them. 
If the lover is unaligned, the couple can either win with the werewolf team or with the lover's win condition.

__Simplified__
The Cupid Wolf is a cupid that has been infected by the infected wolf. The Cupid Wolf's base alignment is werewolf.
