**Spectral Cupid** | Unaligned Align - Nightmare Base Alignment | Limited Transformation
__Basics__
The Spectral Cupid is a cupid that has been recruited onto the nightmare team.
__Details__
Instead of turning into a spirit, the cupid turns into an Spectral Cupid. 
The Spectral Cupid works like the cupid, with one exception: The Spectral Cupid's base alignment is nightmare.
If the lover is part of a different alignment, they will only win when both win conditions are fulfilled. For example, if the couple is Spectral Cupid and a werewolf, everyone else must die. If the lover is also part of the nightmare alignment, they are nightmare aligned and can win together with them. 
If the lover is unaligned, the couple can either win with the nightmare team or with the lover's win condition.

__Simplified__
The Spectral Cupid is a cupid that has been recruited onto the nightmare team. The Spectral Cupid's base alignment is nightmare.
