**Cupid Variants**
The Cupid can never change role to a role that isn't a cupid variant. Every time the Cupid would usually change role, they instead change to a different cupid variant. After picking a lover, or if the lover changes alignment, the cupid may also change role. The following cupid variants exist.

__Cupid__
This is the default cupid role, and the only one that can be in a role list. Unless another case applies the cupid stays as this role.

__Cupid Wolf__
If the cupid is targetted by the infecting wolf, they turn into a cupid wolf instead of a normal wolf.

__Undead Cupid__
If the cupid is demonized and then killed, they turn into an undead cupid instead of into an undead.

__Spectral Cupid__
If the cupid is recruited onto the nightmare team, they turn into a spectral cupid instead of into a spirit.

__Demonic Cupid__
If the cupid's lover is a member of hell, the cupid becomes a demonic cupid, and a full member of hell. Afterwards, the cupid cannot change role again.

__Lupine Cupid__
If the cupid's lover is a member of the wolfpack or wolf team, the cupid becomes a lupine cupid. This does not change the cupid's alignment.

__Flaming Cupid__
If the cupid's lover is a member of the pyro team, the cupid becomes a flaming cupid. This does not change the cupid's alignment.

__Plagued Cupid__
If the cupid's lover is a member of the plague team, the cupid becomes a plagued cupid. This does not change the cupid's alignment.

__Cupid Hag__
If the cupid's lover is a hag, the cupid becomes a cupid hag. The cupid hag shares the win condition of the hags and can be wronged.

__Apocalyptic Cupid__
If the cupid's lover is a horseman, the cupid becomes a apocalyptic cupid. This does not change the cupid's alignment.
