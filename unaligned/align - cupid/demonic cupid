**Demonic Cupid** | Solo Miscellaneous - Hell Team | Transformation
__Basics__
The Demonic Cupid is a cupid whose lover is a member of the hell team.
__Details__
If the cupid selects a lover from the hell team, or if their lover joins the hell team, the cupid turns into a Demonic Cupid.
The Demonic Cupid works like the cupid, with one exception: he Demonic Cupid's alignment is hell.
Once a cupid and their lover have joined the hell team, they cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion of a member will fail in some manner.
If the cupid has a soul then it is lost the moment they become a Demonic Cupid. The hell team gains this soul for their pool of souls.
