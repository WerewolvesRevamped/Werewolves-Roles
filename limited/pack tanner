**Pack Tanner** | Werewolf Power
__Basics__ 
Each day, the Pack Tanner may disguise up to one players as a role of the Pack Tanner’s choosing.
__Details__
Each day, the Pack Tanner can weakly disguise one player; the night after, to roles affected by weak disguises, their role will appear to be what the Pack Tanner has disguised the player as. 
The Pack Tanner may disguise themselves, but they may not disguise the same player twice in a row. Disguising a player is an immediate effect. 
If the Pack Tanner dies, the assigned player will keep their disguise for the night. The player loses their disguise at the end of the night.
The Pack Tanner is not a lycan, but is part of the wolfpack.
