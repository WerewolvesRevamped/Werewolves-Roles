**Rogue Wolf** | Townsfolk Killing | Limited
__Basics__
The Rogue Wolf is a lycan who decries the behaviour of the other wolves and seeks to eliminate them. The Rogue Wolf may attack a player on nights after a successful wolfpack kill.
__Details__
The Rogue Wolf is not a member of the werewolf team or wolfpack, and doesn't know the other werewolves. However, they are still a lycan.
Each night the Rogue Wolf learns if the wolfpack successfully executed a kill the previous night or not. If they did, the Rogue Wolf may themselves attack a player during the night.
The Rogue Wolf is strongly disguised as an arbitrary most common role in the wolfpack, excluding those with permanent or semi-permanent disguises.
Attacking a player is an end-night ability.

__Simplified__
The Rogue Wolf is a part of the townsfolk team, but is a lycan and is disguised as a wolf. The Rogue Wolf may attack a player on nights after a successful wolfpack kill.
