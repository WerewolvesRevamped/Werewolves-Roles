**Rogue Wolf** [Townsfolk Killing]
__Basics__
The Rogue Wolf is a lycan who decries the behaviour of the other wolves and seeks to eliminate them. The Rogue Wolf may attack a player every night, but must successfully kill an enemy of town at least every other night.
__Details__
The Rogue Wolf is not a member of the werewolf team or wolfpack, and doesn't know the other werewolves. However, they are still a lycan.
The Rogue Wolf may attack a player every night. Should they fail to successfully kill a werewolf or solo aligned player two nights in a row, they lose their ability.
The Rogue Wolf is strongly disguised as an arbitrary most common role in the wolfpack, excepting those with permanent or semi-permanent disguises.
Attacking a player is an end-night ability.

__Simplified__
The Rogue Wolf is a part of the townsfolk team, but is a lycan and is disguised as a wolf. The Rogue Wolf may attack a player every night, but must successfully kill an enemy of town at least every other night.
