**Rival** | Unaligned Investigative | Limited Transformation
__Basics__
The Rival can only win when there are no other Rivals left in the game. 
Every night after Night 1, the Rival can investigate a player. They will learn both their role and whether the investigation was affected by another power.
__Details__
The Rival can only exist with another rival in the game. The Rival ascends when all other Rivals have died.
Every night after Night 1, the Rival can investigate a player and will learn their role.
The Rival is affected by weak disguises and redirections. They are told specifically if an investigation was affected by a disguise, an obstruction, or a redirection - if it was unaffected, they are informed of this too.
If the win condition of the Rival changes in any way, they do not require the other Rival to die. 
If the win condition or role of another Rival changes in any way, the Rival still requires any other (original) Rivals to die.
The Rival is nonaligned.
