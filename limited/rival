The Rival can only win when there are no other Rivals left in the game.

Every night after Night 1, the Rival can investigate a player and will learn their role.

If the win condition of the Rival changes in any way, they do not require the other Rival to die. 
If the win condition of another Rival changes in any way, the Rival still requires any other Rivals to die.
