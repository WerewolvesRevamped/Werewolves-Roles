__Herding__

Whenever a player is herded, they will join a secret channel with the other herded players. Becoming herded is a consequence of the action. The Shepherd may see everything said in this channel, from the safety of their secret channel.
Every time someone is herded or unherded the Shepherd will be informed.

All forms of visits or targets count towards being able to herd
Some notable interactions include:
Assistant and Flute player apprentice Herds if the player it redirects is tagged as well
Passing the Amulet of Protection between two tagged players herds both
A tagged player that targets themselves herds themselves, for example a corrupt wolf giving themselves a vote value change would herd only them.
A tagged Devil can be herded by the wager action being used on a tagged player
