__Details__
The Lesser Coyote knows the identity of the other coyotes and shares a channel with them.
The Lesser Coyote is not a lycan, nor are they a member of the wolfpack.
When the last original greater coyote dies, the coyotes' channel is disbanded and the Lesser Coyote joins the wolfpack.

__Simplified__
The Lesser Coyote is part of a group of other coyotes. Should the greater coyote die, the Lesser Coyote joins the wolfpack.
