**Swindler** | Unaligned Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Swindler's goal is to use deception in order to deprive players of their votes. They can swindle one person into losing the value of their voting ballot each night.
When a third of all currently living players have been swindled, the Swindler wins and ascends. After the Swindler wins, the votes are slowly returned - one per night - in the same order they were stolen in. However if they die, the votes are immediately returned instead.
__Details__
Each night, the Swindler can swindle one player. This is an immediate ability.
The target will have their voting ballot swapped for one with a voting power of 0, however the Mayor will retain their additional vote. If the target's voting value is updated after being swindled, the Swindler overrides it and it stays 0.
A Swindler may select themself. Swindling someone does not add the target's vote to the Swindlers own voting power.
When 1/3 of all currently living players (rounded up), including the Swindler, have all been swindled, they ascend and stop playing. The game continues. The Swindler canâ€™t win when they are dead. 
If the Swindler dies, all the swindled votes are immediately returned. However if the Swindler wins, one vote will be returned each night after their ascension, in the order they were swindled. For example, at the start of the first night after the Swindler's ascension, the first swindled vote is returned and so on.

__Simplified__
A Swindler can swindle one person each night, causing their target to have their voting value set to 0.
After 1/3 of all living players (rounded up) have been swindled, counting the Swindler, they win and stop playing. The game continues.
If the Swindler wins, the votes are slowly returned once per night following their ascension, in the order in which they were stolen in. However if they die, the votes are immediately returned instead.
