**Firebug** | Solo Killing - Pyro Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Firebug may ward one player.
__Details__
When the Firebug wards a player, that player is protected from attacks for the night. Should anyone other than a member of the pyro team try to attack the warded player, the attack backfires, powdering the attacker and igniting all powdered players. This is considered an attack executed by the Firebug. If the warded player is not attacked for the entire night, they are powdered at the start of the next day (assuming the Firebug survives the night). The Firebug learns which action it took.
If a Firebug is powdered and ignited, and thus attacked, the ignition fails and the attacker is informed.
Warding is an immediate ability.
The Firebug is a member of the pyro team and channel. The pyro team wins when all other players are dead or unaligned.
When the last original Pyromancer dies, the Firebug turns into a Pyromancer.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Firebug may ward one player. If a warded player is attacked, the attack backfires, causing an ignition. Otherwise, the warded player is powdered at the end of the night.
The Firebug is a member of the pyro team and channel.
