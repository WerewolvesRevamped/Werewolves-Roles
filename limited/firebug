**Firebug** | Solo Killing - Pyro Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Firebug may bug one player or ward a member of the pyro team.
__Details__
If the Firebug bugs a player and the bugged player is attacked, the Firebug will ignite all currently powdered players. If a powdered player survives the attack, they remain powdered. Bugging players does not protect them or affect attacks against them in any way.
If the Firebug wards a player, that player is protected from attacks for the night.
If a Firebug is powdered and ignited, and thus attacked, the ignition fails and the attacker is informed.
Bugging and warding are immediate abilities.
The Firebug is a member of the pyro team and channel. The pyro team wins when all other players are dead or unaligned.
If the last original Pyromancer dies, the Firebug turns into a Pyromancer.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Firebug may bug or ward a player. Attacking a bugged player causes an ignition, whilst warding protects a player.
The Firebug is a member of the pyro team and channel.
