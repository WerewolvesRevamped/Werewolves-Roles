**Firebug** | Solo Killing - Pyro Team
__Basics__
Each night, the Firebug may either powder one player or ward one player.
__Details__
When the Firebug wards a player, that player is protected from attacks for the night. Should anyone other than a member of the pyro team try to attack the warded player, the attack backfires, igniting the attacker as well as all powdered players. This is considered an attack executed by the Firebug.
Powdering and warding are immediate abilities. Instead of powdering the Firebug may also unpowder.
The Firebug is a member of the pyro team and channel.
The Pyros win when they're the last ones alive.
When the last original Pyromancer dies, the Firebug turns into a Pyromancer
