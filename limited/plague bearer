**Plague Bearer** | Solo Killing - Plague Team | Limited
__Basics__ 
The Plague Bearer's disease is lethal and highly contagious. Their desire is to kill off all other players.
__Details__
They start off with rodents that carry the plague. They have one rodent for every six players in the game (rounded).
If there are several Plague Bearers they know each other and share their rodents.
During every night, they may free one of their rodents to contaminate another player. Contaminated players will be affected by the disease.
If the Plague Bearer attempts to contaminate an already contaminated player, they are informed, but the rodent is still used up.
Contaminating a player is an end-night ability. Contaminated players are contagious, and remain so till their death.
Any player who visits or is visited by a contagious player is also immediately contaminated. Any type of action (target, attack, investigation, etc) is counted as a visit.
At the start of the second night after being contaminated the player is informed that they are contaminated.
At the end of the second night after being contaminated the player will die (cannot be avoided, not counted as an attack).
