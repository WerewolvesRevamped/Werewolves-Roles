**Ravenkeeper** | Townsfolk Investigative | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Ravenkeeper may either assign one of its ravens to a player, or use them to spy. When using them to spy, the Ravenkeeper will learn if any of the ravens interact with each other.
__Details__
The Ravenkeeper starts out with 1 raven for every 5 players in the game (rounded down). Each night, the Ravenkeeper may assign one raven to another player. Ravens can also be reassigned from one player to another (ravens that were assigned to dead players will immediately return to the Ravenkeeper upon the player's death). Assigning a raven is an immediate effect. Ravens not assigned to another player are considered to be assigned to the Ravenkeeper.
Instead of assigning a raven, the Ravenkeeper can also use their ravens to spy. Choosing to use the ravens to spy is an immediate effect. For the rest of the night, the Ravenkeeper will be told when a player with a raven uses an action on another player with a raven. The Ravenkeeper will be told the names of both players, and who used the action, but not what sort of action was done.
The Ravenkeeper is affected by redirections.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Ravenkeeper may either assign a raven or spy. Ravens not assigned to a living player are assigned to the Ravenkeeper.
If the Ravenkeeper chooses to spy, it will be told the names of any two players with ravens that interact with each other.
