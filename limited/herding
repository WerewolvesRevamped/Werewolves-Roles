**Herding** | Additional Info - Flock Team

Whenever a player is herded, they will join a secret channel with the other herded players. Becoming herded is a consequence of the action. The Shepherd may see everything said in this channel, from the safety of their secret channel.
Every time someone is herded or unherded the Shepherd will be informed.

All forms of visits count.
Some notable unusual interactions include:
If a player redirects one player's action onto another player, and two (or more) of the involved players are tagged, these players become herded.
Passing the Amulet of Protection between two tagged players herds both.
A tagged player that targets themselves herds themselves, for example a corrupt wolf giving themselves a vote value change herds them.
A tagged Devil can be herded by the wager action being used on a tagged player, as well as by a tagged wager recipient using an action.
