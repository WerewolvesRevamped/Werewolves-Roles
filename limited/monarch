**Monarch** | Extra Elected | Limited
__Basics__
The Monarch is elected during Day 0.
They may knight a player each day, temporarily granting them an extra vote and negating a vote against them.
__Details__
The Monarch can *only* be elected during Day 0: there will be no Monarch election after Day 0. However, if the Monarch dies, the role is passed on to their heir. The Monarch may select a player as their heir; they can update this target once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Monarch wants. 
Neither the knighted player nor the heir are aware of being selected by the Monarch.
The knighted player's vote appears normally on votes: however, an additional vote is counted internally, and the total vote count in the vote results will be correct. Similarly, the vote against the knight that has been negated is still shown in the vote results and the total vote count is decreased by one.
When the heir becomes the new Monarch, they are *not* revealed. If the Monarch dies without a living heir, the role is lost.
Knighting a player and picking an heir are immediate abilities.

__Simplified__
