**Monarch** | Extra Elected | Limited
__Basics__
The Monarch is elected during Day 0.
They may select a heir, who will inherit the Monarch role, should the Monarch die.
Additionally, they are granted an extra vote and a vote against them will be negated.
__Details__
The Monarch can *only* be elected once, usually this is during Day 0, but if no Monarch is elected the election will reoccur until a Monarch is elected. After a Monarch is elected, there will not be any further Monarch elections for the remainder of the game. However, if the Monarch dies, the role is passed on to their heir. The Monarch must select another player as their heir; they can update this target once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Monarch wants. If no heir is selected, a random player is chosen. However, this only applies to the original Monarch; players who gain the Monarch role through the heir mechanic may opt to not select an heir.
The heir is not aware of being selected by the Monarch.
The heir's vote appears normally on votes: however, an additional vote is counted internally, and the total vote count in the vote results will be correct. Similarly, the vote against the heir that has been negated is still shown in the vote results and the total vote count is decreased by one. 
When the heir becomes the new Monarch, they are *not* revealed.
Picking an heir is immediate ability.

__Simplified__
The Monarch is elected during Day 0.
They may secretly pick a player to receive the Monarch role on the current Monarch's death.
Additionally, that player is granted an extra vote and a vote against them will be negated.

__Formalized__
TBD

__Card__
