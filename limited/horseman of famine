**Horseman of Famine** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of Famine may doom a player. Doomed by the Horseman of Famine, they are starved, becoming unrecognizable. Instead, they will permanently be seen as a horseman role.
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. Players doomed by the Horseman of Famine will be permanently and strongly disguised as an arbitrary in-play Horseman role (one that existed when Night 1 starts).
When the Horseman of Famine attempts to doom another Horseman, it fails: the two Horsemen unite, joining a shared channel. Doomed players are informed that they have been doomed, but not which Horseman doomed them. Doomed players can be doomed again by the same or a different Horseman.
Dooming and its accompanying effect persist even if the Horseman of Famine dies, but immediately disappear when no Horsemen remain.
When all remaining Horsemen are united and all remaining players doomed, Doomsday is unleashed: the Horseman of Famine turns into an Apocalyptic Horseman, with the ability to kill a player each night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of Famine may doom a player, disguising them as a Horseman. If they attempt to doom another Horseman, they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may kill a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
