**Horseman of Famine** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of Famine may doom a player. Doomed by the Horseman of Famine, they are starved, becoming unrecognizable. Instead, they will permanently be seen as a horseman role.
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. Players doomed by the Horseman of Famine will be permanently and strongly disguised as an arbitrary in-play Horseman role (one that existed when Night 1 starts).
For more information, check `$i doom`.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of Famine may doom a player, disguising them as a Horseman. If they attempt to doom another Horseman, they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may attack a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
