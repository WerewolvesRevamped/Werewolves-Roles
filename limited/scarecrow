**Scarecrow** | Extra Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
A Scarecrow will pass on their role to another player when they die.
__Details__
When a Scarecrow dies, they will pass on the Scarecrow role to a target they have selected. If their target is part of the townsfolk team, the target's role is erased, and they become a farmer. If they are part of the werewolf team, their role is erased, and they become a farming wolf. If their target is part of another team, then they are granted the Scarecrow role on top of their current role. The alignment of their target is never changed or affected.
A Scarecrow can select a player and update their targeted player once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Scarecrow wants. A Scarecrow player may choose to not target any player, which will stop their power from being used.

__Simplified__
A Scarecrow will pass on their role to another player, whom they have chosen as a target, when they die. If their target is part of the townsfolk or a wolf, their role is erased and replaced by a farmer role of the same alignment. Otherwise, a Scarecrow role is granted on top of their current role.
