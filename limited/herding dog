**Herding Dog** | Solo Power - Flock Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Herding Dog wins with the shepherd and joins a channel with the shepherd to communicate securely.
Similar to the shepherd the Herding Dog can communicate with herded players securely and anonymously, but can only communicate with one player each night in this way.
Additionaly they can also infiltrate the Herded channel in place of another player being herded.
__Details__
Each night the Herding Dog can choose a herded player and add them to a seperate channel to anonymously communicate with them.
The Herding Dog can be herded by the Shepherd.

The Herding Dog will work together with the shepherd and any other Herding Dogs, they will all be part of a flock channel where they can communicate securely.
If the Herding Dog loses their role, they will lose their abilities, they will remain herded if they are herded when losing their role. Role changes are not revealed to the other Flock Team members.
