**Herding Dog** | Solo Miscellaneous - Flock Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Herding Dog wins with the shepherd and joins a channel with the shepherd to communicate securely.
__Details__
During the day, the Herding Dog can un-herd a herded player to steal that player's vote. During the night, if the Herding Dog is attacked, a herded player will be automatically unherded to protect the Herding Dog.
The Herding Dog is usually the result of someone copying the shepherd for various reasons. This is because the shepherd is too powerful for there to be two. Their win condition is the same as the shepherd’s.
