**Amulet Crafter** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
At the start of the first night, the Amulet Crafter grants the *Amulet of Protection* to a random player unknown to them. Whoever holds the amulet is protected from attacks during the night, but may not use their ability for this duration. Additionally, they must pass it to another player during the day.
__Details__
Whoever holds the amulet during the day must pass it to a player who has not previously held the amulet. Selecting a target and passing the amulet is an end-day ability. Should the holder select no or an invalid target, the amulet shatters, resulting in the holder dying (not an attack) and the amulet disappearing.
A player is blocked from using any of their abilities for the entire night while holding the amulet.
Holders of the amulet do not know who gave them the amulet, nor do they know who has previously held it.
If the Amulet Crafter or the current holder dies, the amulet disappears and is out of play.
