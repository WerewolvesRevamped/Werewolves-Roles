**Grave Robber** | Unaligned Align | Limited
__Basics__
The night after a player dies from a lynch, the Grave Robber may take their role and play as it for the rest of the game.
__Details__
The Grave Robber may take the role of a dead player who was lynched in any way the night immediately after. When the Grave Robber takes a role, they receive a new copy of the role and may/must execute any starting abilities necessary for the role. Copying a role is an immediate ability.
If several players died from lynches during the day, the Grave Robber may pick one of them.
Additionally, they are strongly disguised as a Grave Robber for the duration of the game, even if they change role.
The Grave Robber cannot win without copying a role.
