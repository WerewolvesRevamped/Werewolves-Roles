**Detective** | Unaligned Investigative | Limited
__Basics__
During the day, the Detective compiles information on other players. At night, they try to solve the mystery by guessing the contents of the role list. If their guess is correct, the Detective wins.
__Details__
Each day, the Detective has to choose between guessing one player's current role or learning the final role of a dead player. If they guess a player's current role correctly, it is confirmed. The Detective is not affected by any disguises, obstructions, or redirections.
Each night, the Detective must try to submit the contents (players and their roles) of the entire starting role configuration in their secret channel. If their guess is correct, they ascend and win the game. If their guess is wrong, they are informed how many guesses (but not which ones) were correct. The Detective may submit a partial configuration, but only a complete configuration can let them ascend.
In games with a partial or private role list, the Detective may receive a role list similar to that of the knowledgeable wolf at the start of the game.

__Simplified__
The Detective wins by figuring out the original roles of all players.
Each day, the Detective may either guess one player's current role or learn the final role of a dead player.
