**Cleric** | Townsfolk Power
__Basics__
When all hope seems lost, with no elected roles remaining, the clerics can once bless a player, protecting them for the night.
__Details__
After Night 1, the Cleric may once per game bless a player at night. However, the Cleric may only use their powers if no elected roles exist. Blessing a player is an immediate ability.
When the Cleric blesses a player, they cannot die in any way throughout the rest of the night.
Blessing a player is an immediate action.
The Cleric may bless themself.
If a blessed player evades an attack, the attacker is told it was due to their target being blessed.

__Simplified__
Once per game, at night, the Cleric may bless a player to protect them from any death for the remainder of the night.
If a blessed player evades an attack, the attacker is told it was due to their target being blessed.

__Formalized__
Immediate Night: [Quantity: 1, Condition: not ((@(Role:Mayor) exists) or (@(Role:Reporter) exists) or (@(Role:Guardian) exists))]
    • Protect @Selection from `All` (~Phase)
    • Target @Selection (~Phase)
