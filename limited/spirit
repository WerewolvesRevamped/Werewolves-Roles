**Spirit** | Solo Miscellaneous - Nightmare Team | Limited Transformation
__Basics__
The Spirit is a part of the reaperâ€™s secret army and pretends to be their old role. When the reaper uses a recruitment power on a player, they become a Spirit.
__Details__
The Spirit wins together with the Reaper.
They lose their previous role, but if they were part of a group like the wolfpack, they will remain in the channel and will still be able to vote as long as at least one other member of their group is still alive. However, their vote will not be counted.  
If all members of a group have changed role or died, the group is disbanded and any abilities it may have had are lost.

__Simplified__
The Spirit is a part of the reaper's team. If the reaper uses a recruitment power on a player, they become a Spirit, losing their previous role.
