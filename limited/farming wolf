**Farming Wolf** | Werewolf Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Farming Wolf will pass on their role to another player when they die.
__Details__
When the Farming Wolf dies, they will pass on their role to a target they have selected. If their target is part of the townsfolk team, the target's role is erased, and they become a farmer. If they are part of the werewolf team, their role is erased, and they become a Farming Wolf role. If their target is part of another team, then they are granted the scarecrow role on top of their current role. The alignment of their target is never changed or affected,
The Farming Wolf can select a player and update their targeted player once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Farming Wolf wants. The Farmer Wolf may choose to not target any player, which will stop their power from being used.
The Farming Wolf is a lycan, but is not a member of the wolfpack. Should a player that was previously part of the wolfpack be converted to a Farming Wolf then they may remain in the wolfpack as a visitor.

__Simplified__
The Farming Wolf will pass on their role to another player, whom they have chosen as a target, when they die. If their target is part of the townsfolk or a wolf, their role is erased and replaced by a farmer role of the same alignment. Otherwise, a scarecrow role is granted on top of their current role.
