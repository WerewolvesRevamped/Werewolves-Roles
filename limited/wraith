**Wraith** | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Wraith wins with the reaper and joins a channel with the reaper to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Wraith does not have any special abilities. If somebody tries to copy the reaper, they become a Wraith instead. The Wraith starts out sleepless.
When a sleepless player uses a power other than targeting on the Wraith, their power fails and the Wraith immediately attacks them.
If the (original) reaper dies, the Wraith may turn one player sleepless each night.

__Simplified__
The Wraith wins with the reaper and joins a channel with the reaper to communicate securely.
Using a power on the Wraith will result in a counter-attack.
