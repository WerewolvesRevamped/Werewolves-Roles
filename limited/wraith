**Wraith** | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team 
__Basics__
The Wraith wins with the reaper and joins a channel with the reaper to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Wraith does not have any special abilities. If somebody tries to copy the reaper a Wraith is created instead. The Wraith cannot become sleepless.
When a sleepless player uses a power on the Wraith, their power fails and the Wraith immediately attacks them.
One exception is that sleepless players may still target the Wraith.
