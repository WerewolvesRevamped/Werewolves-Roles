**Wraith** | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Wraith wins with the reaper and joins a channel with the reaper to communicate securely.
__Details__
The Wraith does not have any special abilities. If somebody tries to copy the reaper a Wraith is created instead. The Wraith cannot become sleepless.
When a sleepless player uses a power on the Wraith, their power fails and the Wraith immediately attacks them.
One exception is that sleepless players may still target the Wraith.
If the (original) Reaper dies, the Wraith may turn one player sleepless each night.

__Simplified__
The Wraith wins with the reaper and joins a channel with the reaper to communicate securely.
When a sleepless player attempts to use a power on the Wraith, it fails and the Wraith immediately attacks them.
