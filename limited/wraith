**Wraith** | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Wraith wins with the reaper and joins a channel with the reaper to communicate securely.
At night, the Wraith may turn a player sleepless.
__Details__
Each night, the Wraith may immediately turn one player sleepless. If somebody tries to copy the reaper, they become a Wraith instead. The Wraith starts out sleepless.
When a sleepless player uses a power other than targeting on the Wraith, their power fails and the Wraith immediately attacks them.

__Simplified__
The Wraith wins with the reaper and joins a channel with the reaper to communicate securely.
Each night, the Wraith may immediately turn one player sleepless.
Using a power on the Wraith while sleepless will result in a counter-attack.
