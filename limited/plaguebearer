**Plaguebearer** | Graveyard Power
__Basics__
The Plaguebearer is an alternative version of the vampire.
__Details__
Instead of demonizing, the Plaguebearer taints players. Instead of undead the Plaguebearer has zombies. A demonized player can't be tainted, and a tainted player can't be demonized. If tainting/demonizing fails the player is informed.
