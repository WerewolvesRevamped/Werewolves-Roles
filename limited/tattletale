**Tattletale** | Townsfolk Investigative | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Tattletale may check a target to determine if they are a "threat" or "not a threat". The result will be sent to another player.
__Details__
The Tattletale checks whether a player is a threat or not. Lycans and players with killing roles are classified as threats.
Inspecting a player in this way is an end night ability affected by strong disguises and redirections. 
The results of the Tattletale's investigation will be sent to a random player with a miscellaneous role. The player will receive the name of the investigated player and whether or not they appeared as a threat, but not the name of the Tattletale.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Tattletale may check a player. Lycans and roles classified as killing roles show up as a threat, while all other roles are not a threat.
The results are sent to a random miscellaneous role.
The Tattletale is affected by strong disguises and redirections.
