**Tattletale** | Townsfolk Investigative
__Basics__
Each night, the Tattletale may check a target to determine if they are a "threat" or "not a threat". The result will be sent to another player.
__Details__
The Tattletale checks whether a player is a threat or not. Lycans and players with killing roles are classified as threats.
Inspecting a player in this way is an immediate ability affected by strong disguises and redirections. 
The results of the Tattletale's investigation will be sent to a random player with a miscellaneous role at the start of the day. This will happen even if the Tattletale dies during the night. The player will receive the name of the investigated player and whether or not they appeared as a threat, but not the name of the Tattletale.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Tattletale may check a player. Lycans, and roles classified as killing roles show up as a threat, while all other roles are not a threat.
However the results are sent to a random miscellaneous role.
They are affected by strong disguises and redirections.
