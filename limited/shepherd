**Shepherd** | Solo Power - Flock Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Shepherd may tag two players. If two tagged players visit each other, they both become herded. When everyone is dead, herded or part of the flock team the Shepherd wins.
__Details__
When a tagged player visits another tagged player they become herded but remain tagged, if they then visit or are visited by another tagged player who is not herded then that player is then also herded. Tagging a player is an immediate ability.
Additionally each night the Shepherd can choose to make one tagged player herded as an end night effect.
Whenever a player is herded, they will join a secret channel with the other herded players. Becoming herded is a consequence of the action. The Shepherd may see everything said in this channel, from the safety of their secret channel. 
Members of the flock can not be tagged or herded.
Every time someone is herded or unherded the Shepherd will be informed.
During the day, the Shepherd may temporarily steal the votes of herded players; players who have their votes stolen will be unherded, but remain tagged. Players with negative votes can't have their negative votes stolen (but will still be unherded). The Mayor's extra vote cannot be stolen. The Shepherd is informed how many votes they have after stealing votes. After the day ends, the votes are returned to normal.
During the night, if there's two or more herded players, the Shepherd is protected from attacks. Every time the Shepherd is attacked, two random herded players will immediately be unherded instead. 
At the start of the game, the Shepherd may choose a role as a strong disguise. If the Shepherd doesnâ€™t choose a role, they will be disguised as a citizen. If the Shepherd changes role, the disguise is lost.
If the game started with more than 20 players, the Shepherd may tag three players each night, instead of two.
If no members of the flock team or channel remain all players are no longer herded, however they are not informed about this.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Shepherd may tag a certain amount of players. If two tagged players visit each other, they both become herded. The Shepherd can also herd a tagged player each night.  When everyone is dead, herded or part of the flock team the Shepherd wins.
During the day, the Shepherd can un-herd a herded player to steal that player's vote.
During the night, if the the Shepherd is attacked and there are at least two herded players, two random herded players will be automatically unherded to protect the Shepherd.
