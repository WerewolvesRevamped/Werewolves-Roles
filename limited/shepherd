**Shepherd** | Solo Power - Flock Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Shepherd may tag two players. If two tagged players visit each other, they both become herded. When everyone is dead, herded or part of the flock team the Shepherd wins.
__Details__
When a tagged player visits another tagged player both tagged players become herded but remain tagged. Tagging a player is an immediate ability.
Additionally each night the Shepherd can choose to make one tagged player herded as an end night effect.
Members of the flock can not be tagged or herded.
During the first phase, the Shepherd can choose a role as a strong disguise (defaults to citizen).
More herding information can be found using `$i herding`
Members of the flock team may use Herded players to gain temporary powers, more information can be found in `$i Flock Power`

If the game started with more than 20 players, the Shepherd may tag three players each night, instead of two.
If no members of the flock team or channel remain all players are no longer tagged/herded, however they are not informed about this.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Shepherd may tag a certain amount of players. If two tagged players visit each other, they both become herded. The Shepherd can also herd a tagged player each night.  When everyone is dead, herded or part of the flock team the Shepherd wins.
During the day, the Shepherd can un-herd a herded player to steal that player's vote.
During the night, if the the Shepherd is attacked and there are at least two herded players, two random herded players will be automatically unherded to protect the Shepherd.
