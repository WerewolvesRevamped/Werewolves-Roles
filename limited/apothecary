**Apothecary** | Townsfolk Killing | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Apothecary may poison a player, killing them at the end of the next night. Alternatively, they may cure the player they last poisoned.
__Details__
The Apothecary starts the game with three flasks of poison and a single antidote.
When the Apothecary poisons a player, that player will be killed at the end of the next night (this is not an attack). The Apothecary will only poison a player if they survive the night. 
Instead of poisoning a player, the Apothecary may also use their antidote to cure the player they have previously poisoned, saving them from death.
Players are not notified of being poisoned or cured.
Both actions are immediate abilities.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Apothecary may poison a player, killing them at the end of the next night. Alternatively, they may cure the player they last poisoned.
