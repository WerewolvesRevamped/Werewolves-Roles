**Alcoholic** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Alcoholic spends the night drinking at the tavern and is thus absent for any attacks on them.
__Details__
During the night, the Acoholic is fully immune against all attacks targeting them, though they may still be killed by other means.
The Alcoholic cannot exist without a bartender, and loses their power as soon as the bartender dies. The Alcoholic dies at the end of the first night without a living Bartender.

__Simplified__
At night, the Alcoholic is immune against all attacks, but dies when the Bartender dies.
