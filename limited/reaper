**Reaper** | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Reaper wins when all players are dead, sleepless, unaligned or nightmare-aligned.
For each player that dies, the Reaper may use a power, corresponding to their role's category, to turn another player sleepless.
__Details__
The Reaper starts out sleepless and shares a channel with other members of the nightmare team.

At the start of every night, the Reaper will be informed of what powers they will be able to use. This depends on the categories of the roles of all players that have died since the start of the previous night. Each of the powers the Reaper may use is immediate and will turn the target sleepless, however for some categories there are additional effects.
For *Killing* roles the additional effect is an attack, for *Investigative* roles it is a role investigation, for *Recruitment* and *Align* roles a player may be converted into a spirit.
All other role categories have no additional effect and just turn the target sleepless.

Sleepless players are not aware of being sleepless, however when one of them uses a power (except for targeting) on the Reaper, their power fails and the Reaper immediately attacks them. 

The Reaper is affected by all disguises, obstructions and redirections.

If no members of the nightmare team or channel remain, all players are no longer sleepless, however they are not informed about this.

__Simplified__
The Reaper wins when all players are sleepless or dead.
The Reaper may use a set of powers based on the roles of dead players, to turn others sleepless.
Powers used on the Reaper may result in a counter-attack.
