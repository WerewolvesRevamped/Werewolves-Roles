**Reaper** | Solo Power - Nightmare Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Reaper wins when all players are dead, unaligned, sleepless or nightmare-aligned.
For each player that dies, the Reaper may use a power to turn another player sleepless.
__Details__
The Reaper starts out sleepless and shares a channel with other members of the nightmare team.

At the start of every night, the Reaper will be informed of which powers they may use that night. These powers correspond to the role categories of the players who have died since the start of the previous night.
For each *Killing* role that has died, the Reaper may turn one player sleepless and attack them.
For each *Investigative* role that has died, the Reaper may turn one player sleepless and investigate their role.
For each *Power* role that has died, the Reaper may turn one player sleepless and nullify their public voting power for as long as that player is sleepless.
For all other roles that have died, the Reaper may turn one player sleepless.

The Reaper is not told which role category the dead players belonged to: they are only informed of which powers (kills, investigations, vote nulifications, and basic powers) are available to them. If the Reaper chooses not to use one of their powers during the night, they lose that instance of the power.

Sleepless players are not informed of their being sleepless: however, if a sleepless player uses an ability other than targeting on the Reaper, their ability fails and the Reaper immediately attacks them. 

The Reaper is affected by all disguises, obstructions and redirections when using their powers. They gain powers solely based on the true roles of those who have died.

If no members of the nightmare team or channel remain, the sleepless effect is silently removed from all players.

__Simplified__
The Reaper wins when all players are sleepless or dead.
The Reaper may use a set of powers, based on the roles of dead players, to turn others sleepless.
Abilities used on the Reaper will result in a counter-attack.
