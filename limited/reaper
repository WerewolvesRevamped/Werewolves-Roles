**Reaper** | Solo Power - Nightmare Team 
__Basics__
Each night the Reaper may turn one player sleepless.
The Reaper wins when all living players have been turned sleepless.
Additionally, the Reaper may use the powers of dead players, temporarily.
__Details__
The Reaper knows the roles of all dead players, and is informed as soon as they die. During the next day and/or night the Reaper will be able to use the power of every player that has died since the start of the previous day/night.
The gained abilities can only be used during this/these phase(s), and are lost after that. Day abilities have to be used during the day and night abilities during the night. General abilities can be used during both the next day and night.
If one of the dead players had a disguise when they died, their disguise is applied to the Reaper for two phases.
Use `$info reaper abilities` for a detailed explanation on how the reaper can use certain abilities.

Each night, the Reaper can immediately turn one player sleepless. 
Players are privately informed when they become sleepless. The Reaper cannot become sleepless, nor can other members of the nightmare team or channel.
The Reaper cannot use any powers on a player they have already turned sleepless.
However, when a sleepless player uses a power on the Reaper, their power fails and they die. 
One exception is that sleepless players may still target the Reaper.
If no members of the nightmare team or channel remain all players are no longer sleepless, however they are not informed about this.
