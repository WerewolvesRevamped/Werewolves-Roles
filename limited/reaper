**Reaper** | Solo Killing - Nightmare Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Reaper wins when all players are sleepless, dead or part of the nightmare team.
Each night, the Reaper may turn one player sleepless.
Additionally, the Reaper may temporarily use the general powers of dead players.
__Details__
Each night, the Reaper can immediately turn one player sleepless. That player is not informed in any way.
When a sleepless player uses a power (except for targeting) on the Reaper, their power fails and the Reaper automatically attacks them (immediate). 
When any other player uses a power (except for targeting) on the Reaper, it is redirected onto a target chosen by the Reaper. The Reaper may only select/update their target if they gain this ability as a consequence of a player dying (see below). If no target is selected or the target is dead, the ability is not redirected.

At the start of every night, the Reaper learns the final role of all players that have died since the start of the previous night. The Reaper will then be able to use an ability depending on the category of each of those players.

Killing roles allow the Reaper to attack one player (end night).
Power roles allow the Reaper to turn an additional player sleepless (immediate).
Investigative roles allow the Reaper to check the role of one player (immediate, affected by all disguises, redirections, and obstructions).
Recruitment and Align roles allow the Reaper to convert a player into a spirit (immediate).
Other roles allow the Reaper to update the target of their redirection (immediate).

If no members of the nightmare team or channel remain all players are no longer sleepless, however they are not informed about this.

__Simplified__
The Reaper wins when all players are sleepless, dead or part of the nightmare team.
Each night the Reaper may turn one player sleepless.
Additionally, the Reaper may use a set of powers based on the roles of dead players, temporarily.
Powers used on the Reaper may result in a counter-attack or may be redirected.
