**Recluse** | Werewolf Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Recluse is immediately notified of all powers used on them. When a werewolf uses a power on them, they are given that werewolf's identity.
__Details__
The Recluse is told which role targeted them and what power was used on them, but not the identity of the player that used a power on them. An exception are members of the wolfpack/werewolf team - when they use a power on the Recluse, the Recluse is told the identity of that player as well.
The Recluse is not a lycan and is not part of the wolfpack.
Should a wolfish attempt to attack the Recluse, the attack fails.

__Simplified__
The Recluse and the wolfpack do not know each other.
The Recluse is immediately notified of all powers used on them. When a werewolf uses a power on them, they are given that werewolf's identity.
