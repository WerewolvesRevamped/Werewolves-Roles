**Coyote Pup** | Werewolf Group
__Basics__
The Coyote Pup shares a secret channel with the other coyotes: however, the coyotes do not know the identities of any other wolves.
__Details__
The Coyote Pup knows the identity of the other coyotes and shares a channel with them.
The Coyote Pup is not a lycan, nor are they a member of the wolfpack.
When the last original Greater Coyote dies, the coyotes' channel is disbanded and the Coyote Pup joins the wolfpack.

__Simplified__
The Coyote Pup is a packless non-lycan wolf who is part of a group of other coyotes. Should the Greater Coyote die, the Coyote Pup joins the wolfpack.
