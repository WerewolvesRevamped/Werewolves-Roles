**Farmer** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Farmer will pass on their role to another player when they die.
__Details__
When the Farmer dies, they will pass on their role to a target they have selected. If their target is part of the townsfolk team, their role is erased and replaced by Farmer. If they are part of the werewolf team, their role is erased and replaced by the wolf-aligned Farming Wolf role. If their target is part of another team, they are granted the Scarecrow role on top of their current role. The alignment of their target is never changed or affected,
The Farmer can select a player and update their targeted player once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Farmer wants. The Farmer may choose to not target any player, which will stop their power from being used.

__Simplified__
The Farmer will pass on their role to another player, which they have chosen as a target, when they die. If their target is part of town, or a wolf, their role is erased and replaced by a farmer role of the same alignment. Otherwise, a Scarecrow role is granted on top of their current role.
