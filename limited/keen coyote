**Keen Coyote** | Werewolf Group | Limited
__Basics__
The Keen Coyote shares a secret channel with the other coyotes and can perceive players each night to determine whether they have a threatening presence.
__Details__
The Keen Coyote cannot see a player’s role, but they can check whether or not they are a threat. Lycans, and roles classified as killing roles have a threatening presence. The inspection is an immediate ability and is affected by strong disguises and redirections.
The Keen Coyote knows the identity of the other coyotes and shares a channel with them.
The Keen Coyote is not a lycan, nor are they a member of the wolfpack.
When the last original greater coyote dies, the coyotes' channel is disbanded and the Keen Coyote joins the wolfpack.

__Simplified__
The Keen Coyote is part of a group of other coyotes. Should the greater coyote die, the Lesser Coyote joins the wolfpack.
The Keen Coyote can perceive players each night to determine whether they have a threatening presence.
