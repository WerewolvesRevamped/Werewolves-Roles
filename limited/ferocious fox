**Ferocious Fox** | Werewolf Killing
__Basics__
Each day, the Ferocious Fox may target a player, and the target will be known to the Wolfpack. At the end of the next night, the Ferocious Fox will attack the selected target. Once per game, the Ferocious Fox may alternatively join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
__Details__
Each day, the Ferocious Fox may either target a player or choose to join the wolfpack.
The Hosts announce the target to the wolfpack at the start of each night. The Ferocious Fox may cancel their attack during the night, but they cannot change target.
The Ferocious Fox and wolfpack do not know each other's identities, as the Ferocious Fox is not a lycan, nor a member of the wolfpack. 
If the Ferocious Fox chooses to join the wolfpack, they may not target anyone that day, and will lose their power as they will become a regular wolf. 
Joining the wolfpack, choosing a target and cancelling the attack are immediate abilities. Attacking a player is an end-night ability. 
If the Ferocious Fox attacks someone who isn’t on the Townsfolk team or a Solo role, they die.
