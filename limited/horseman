**Horseman** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team | Limited
__Basics__
At the end of Day 0, the Horseman becomes one of the other Horseman roles.
__Details__
The Horseman can not immediately become an Apocalyptic Horseman.
Each Horseman can doom a player every night, the effect of which depends on the type of Horseman.
When a Horseman attempts to doom another Horseman it fails and the two Horsemen unite, joining a shared channel. Doomed players are informed that they have been doomed, but not which Horseman doomed them. Doomed players can be doomed again by the same or a different Horseman.
When all remaining Horsemen are united and all remaining players doomed, Doomsday is unleashed: all Horsemen turn into Apocalyptic Horsemen, with the ability to attack a player each night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
At the end of Day 0, the Horseman becomes one of the other Horseman roles.
