**Horseman of Pestilence** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of Pestilence may doom a player. Too sick to act, any attempt of that player to use an ability during that night and following day will fail.
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. For the rest of the night and the following day, any attempts to use an active ability will fail for that player. This also applies for group actions, should the doomed player be chosen to execute it. For some abilities, this may be indistinguishable from other failures (attacks), while others have no other way of failing (investigations). Passive abilities, like Runner, are not affected.
For more information, check `$i doom`.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of Pestilence may doom a player, blocking their ability during the night and following day. If they attempt to doom another Horseman, they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may attack a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
