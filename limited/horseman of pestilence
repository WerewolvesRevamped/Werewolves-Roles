**Horseman of Pestilence** | Solo Power - Horsemen Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Horseman of Pestilence may doom a player. Too sick to act, any attempt of that player to use an ability during the following day and night will fail.
__Details__
Dooming a player is an immediate effect. For the following day and night, any attempts to use an active ability will fail for that player, as they will be *ability blocked*. 
For more information, check `$i doom`.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Horseman of Pestilence may doom a player, blocking their ability during the following day and night. If they attempt to doom another Horseman, they instead join a shared channel. When all players are doomed, each Horseman may attack a player every night. The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
