**None** | Unaligned | Technical
__Basics__
The main goal for the None is to ping the Game Masters, so they realize they forgot to assign a role to the None. After night 1, the None may choose a Game Master to kill each night. 
__Details__
The None is a rare role that is theoretically possible to gain, but should seldom appear in games, since it is only obtainable via the bot being broken, or the Game Masters forgetting to assign a role.
The None can win with any team except the wolves, even if their win condition is to kill all others.
Killing a Game Master is an end effect.
