**Amulet of Protection** | Extra Power | Limited
__Basics__
The Amulet of Protection is in play, if an Amulet Crafter is in the game.
As long as you hold the amulet, you cannot die from attacks during the night, but you may not use your abilities for this duration. Additionally, you must pass it to another player during the day.
__Details__
While you cannot die through an attack, you can still die by other means. If that happens, the amulet disappears. The same happens if the Amulet Crafter dies.
During the day, you must pass it to a player who has not previously held the amulet. Selecting a target and passing the amulet is an end-day ability. Should you choose an invalid or no target, the amulet shatters, resulting in you dying (not an attack) and the amulet disappearing.
During the night, you are obstructed from using any of your abilities for the entire night.
Holders of the amulet do not know who gave them the amulet, nor do they know who has previously held it.

__Simplified__
The Amulet of Protection is in play if an Amulet Crafter is in the game.

If you fail to pass the amulet to a player who has not previously had the amulet, the amulet shatters, and you die.
