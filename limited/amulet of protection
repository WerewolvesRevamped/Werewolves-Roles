**Amulet of Protection** | Extra Miscellaneous | Limited
__Basics__
The Amulet of Protection is in play, if an Amulet Holder is in the game. The Amulet Holder is the original holder of the amulet.
As long as you hold the amulet, you cannot die by attacks during the night, but you must pass it to another player during the day.
__Details__
While you cannot die through an attack, you can still die by other means. If that happens, the amulet shatters.
When passing the amulet, up to three players may be specified (either at once or separately) and the amulet will be passed to the first player who has not previously had the amulet. Selecting a target is an immediate effect and, should the selection fail, the holder is immediately informed (and if applicable, the next selection is attempted). However, passing the amulet is an end-day ability. If the holder does not or cannot choose a player to pass the amulet to, it shatters at the end of the day, instead of being passed. 
If the current target to gain the amulet dies during the day the next eligible player will recieve the amulet, if there are no other eligible players left in the list the amulet shatters.
Holders of the amulet do not know who gave them the amulet, nor do they know who has previously held it.
If the original amulet holder dies or choose to, the amulet shatters. When the amuelt shatter, the current holder is attacked by the original amulet holder.
