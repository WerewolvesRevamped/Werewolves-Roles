**Juror** | Townsfolk Group | Limited
__Basics__
The Jurors have a secret channel where they can communicate among themselves securely. During certain nights, the jury votes to investigate a player.
If the jury successfuly investigates a non-town role, it is announced.
__Details__
The Juror is part of the jury. During certain nights, the jury can vote to investigate a player. 
The jury recieves the result of the investigation at the end of the night. If the result of the investigation shows a non-town role, the role is announced publicly.
The jury is disbanded if there are 1 or less Jurors left; this means the jury is active only if at least two Jurors are alive. 
Any member of the jury, even if they lose their role, can still vote on who to investigate. 
One of the Jurors that has voted for the jury's target is randomly chosen as the investigator, who performs the investigations. 
The jury is affected by weak disguises and obstructions. These effects are seen from the investigator's perspective.
The jury's first check happens during Night 2. If the jury started with two Jurors they may check again each night. For every additional Juror the jury started with they have to wait an additional night between checks.

The Jurors share a secret channel and know each other. During certain nights, the jury votes to investigate a player.
If the jury successfuly investigates a non-town role, it is announced publically.
