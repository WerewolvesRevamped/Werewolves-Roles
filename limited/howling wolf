**Howling Wolf** | Werewolf Killing | Limited
__Basics__
Once per game, the Howling Wolf may disguise all players as an arbitrary in-play wolf role.
Once per game, the Howling Wolf may provide an extra poll for the wolfpack for the next night.
__Details__
The Howling Wolf has two cries: a masking cry and a striking cry. Each day, they can choose whether they want to use one or both cries. Each cry can only be used once. Crying is an end day ability.
If they use the masking cry, all players will be strongly disguised as an arbitrary in-play werewolf team role. If possible, the disguise matches their role's category. Disguising players in this way is not a visit.
If they use the striking cry, they will create a new poll for the wolfpack that the members can vote on during the following night. The player selected on this poll will be attacked by the Howling Wolf at the end of the night.
If the striking cry is used, lycans in the wolfpack will be unable to perform individual actions during the night that the poll is active.
The fact that a cry has been used, but not its type, will be announced at the start of the night after the Howling Wolf chooses to use it. If both cries are used during one phase, the fact that a cry has been used is only announced once.

__Simplified__
Once per game the Howling Wolf may disguise every player as an arbitrary in play wolf role.
Once per game during the day the Howling Wolf may provide an extra poll for the wolfpack the next night, at the cost of wolfpack actions.

__Formalized__
TBD

__Card__
When Howling Wolf how- ls at the moon, they may get answered by a maskmaker's passion or a pack's fury.
