**Howling Wolf** | Werewolf Killing | Limited
__Basics__
Once per game during the day the Howling Wolf may disguise all players as an arbitrary in play wolf role.
Once per game during the day the Howling Wolf may provide an extra poll for the wolfpack the next night.
__Details__
The Howling Wolf has two cries; a masking cry and a striking cry. Each day, they can choose whether they want to use either of those cries. Each cry can only be used once. They can also be used simultaneously in one day.
If they use the masking cry, then all players will be strongly disguised as an arbitrary in play werewolf team role, which (if possible) matches their role's category (end-day). This does not count as a visit.
If they use the striking cry, they will create a new poll for the wolfpack that the members can vote on, whoever is selected will be attacked by the Howling Wolf at the end of the night (end-day).
If the striking cry is used, lycans in the wolfpack will be unable to perform individual actions the night that the poll is active.
At the start of night, if the Howling Wolf has decided to use one or more cries it is announced but not how many or which ones have been used.

__Simplified__
Once per game the Howling Wolf may disguise every player as an arbitrary in play wolf role.
Once per game during the day the Howling Wolf may provide an extra poll for the wolfpack the next night, at the cost of wolfpack actions.
