**Gallant Fox** | Werewolf Power | Limited
__Basics__
Each day, the Gallant Fox may select a player to protect from attacks and the lynch during the following night and day phases, and the chosen player will be announced to the wolfpack. Once per game, the Gallant Fox may alternatively join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
__Details__
The chosen player will be protected from attacks and lynches during the following night and day phases (but not during the current day phase!), but can still die through other means. The protection does not wear off early if the Gallant Fox dies or changes role.
If the Gallant Fox survives the day, the wolfpack is informed at the start of the night that the Gallant Fox has chosen to protect a player and what player it is.
The Gallant Fox is neither a lycan, nor a member of the wolfpack.
If the Gallant Fox chooses to join the wolfpack, they may not select a player to protect, and will lose their power as they will become a regular wolf.
Joining the wolfpack and selecting a disguise are immediate abilities.

__Simplified__
The Gallant Fox and the wolfpack do not know each other.
Each day, the Gallant Fox may select a player to protect from attacks and the lynch during the following night and day phases. At the end of the day, the chosen player will be announced to the wolfpack. Once per game, the Gallant Fox may alternatively give up their power to join the wolfpack as a regular wolf.
