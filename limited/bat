**Bat** | Solo Recruitment - Underworld Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night, the Bat haunts another player. The Bat will not be killed by attacks targetting them, but will be affected by those taking place at their target’s house.
Any player that interacts with the Bat's target while the Bat is visiting becomes demonized.
__Details__
Since the Bat is haunting another player's house and not at home, any attack targeting the Bat will fail; however if the person they're haunting is attacked, then they're both attached.
Choosing a player to haunt is an end day ability, and the Bat will stay with their target the whole night
Additionally, any player that uses an ability on the haunted player will be demonized, and the Bat will be told their name.
If the Bat is haunting another player while being protected from attacks, the protection is ignored; only protections for the player they are haunting apply.
The Bat is part of the Underworld team and channel. The Bat is demonized from the start of the game and may be turned into an undead.

__Simplified__
Each day, the Bat may choose a demonized or underworld player to haunt in the following night. The Bat will not be affected by attacks targetting them, but will instead be affected by those taking place at their target’s house. 
Any player that interacts with the Bat's target while the Bat is visiting also becomes demonized, and the Bat is told their name.
The Bat is demonized from the start.
