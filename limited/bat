**Bat** | Solo Recruitment - Underworld Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each day, the Bat may choose one player to haunt in the following night. The Bat will not be affected by attacks targetting them, but will instead be affected by those taking place at their target’s house. Any player that interacts with the Bat's target while the Bat is visiting becomes demonized.
__Details__
Choosing a player to haunt is an end-day ability. Throughout the following night, they will stay with that player. The Bat may also choose not to haunt anybody. Since the Bat is at the other player’s house and not at home, any attacks targeting the Bat in the night will fail; however, if the person they’re haunting is being attacked, then the Bat is also attacked. Any player that interacts with the Bat's target in any way while the Bat is visiting will become demonized immediately, and the Bat is told the name of the newly demonized player.
The Bat may not haunt the same player twice and can only haunt demonized players or members of the underworld team. If they select an invalid player, their action will fail and they will be informed.
If the Bat is haunting another player while being protected from attacks, the protection is ignored; only protections for the player they are haunting apply.
The Bat is part of the Underworld team and channel. The Bat is demonized from the start of the game and may be turned into an undead.
