**Greater Coyote** | Werewolf Killing | Limited
__Basics__
The Greater Coyote is a packless non-lycan wolf who shares a channel with the other coyotes. None of the coyotes know the identities of any other wolves. If the Greater Coyote dies, the coyote group is disbanded.
__Details__
If the wolfpack fails to kill a townsfolk player on any given night, the coyotes may kill a player during the following night. The coyotes decide their target by voting.
If at any point there is no living Greater Coyote, the coyote group is disbanded. All other coyotes join the wolfpack.
Any member of the coyote group without their original role can still vote on who to attack.
The coyotes' attack is an end-night ability, and is always reactively executed by a Greater Coyote.

__Simplified__
If the pack fails to kill a townsfolk, the coyotes can vote to attack one player during the following night. 
When the Greater Coyote dies, the coyotes are disbanded and join the wolfpack instead.
