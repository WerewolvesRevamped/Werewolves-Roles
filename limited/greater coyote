**Greater Coyote** | Werewolf Killing | Limited
__Basics__
The Greater Coyote is a packless non-lycan wolf who shares a channel with the other coyotes: however, none of the coyotes know the identities of any other wolves. If the Greater Coyote dies, the coyote group is disbanded.
__Details__
If the wolfpack fails to kill a townsfolk on any given night, the coyotes may kill a player during the following night. The coyotes decides their target by voting.
If at any point there is no living Greater Coyote, the coyote group is disbanded and all other coyotes join the wolfpack.
Any member of the coyote group without their original role can still vote on who to attack.
The coyotes' attack is an end-night ability and is always reactively executed by a Greater Coyote.

__Simplified__
The Greater Coyote shares a secret channel with the other coyotes.
If the pack fails to kill a townsfolk, the coyotes can vote to attack one player during the following night. 
When the Greater Coyote dies, the coyotes are disbanded, joining the wolfpack instead.
