**Greater Coyote** | Werewolf Killing | Limited
__Basics__
The Greater Coyote is a packless non-lycan wolf who shares a channel with the other coyotes: however, none of the coyotes know the identities of any other wolves. If the Greater Coyote dies, the coyote group is disbanded.
__Details__
If the wolfpack fails to kill a townsfolk on any given night, the coyotes may kill a player during the following night. The coyotes decides their target by voting.
If the Greater Coyote dies, the coyote group is disbanded. All other coyotes lose any remaining abilities and join the wolfpack. This is not triggered by the Greater Coyote changing role.
Any member of the coyote group without their original role can still vote on who to attack.
The coyotes' attack is an end-night ability.

__Simplified__
The Greater Coyote shares a secret channel with the other coyotes.
If the pack fails to kill a townsfolk, the coyotes can vote to attack one player during the following night. 
When the Greater Coyote dies, the coyotes lose their abilities and are disbanded, joining the wolfpack instead.
