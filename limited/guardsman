**Guardsman** | Townsfolk Killing | Limited
__Basics__
Once, the Guardsman may choose to be on guard for the rest of the night. Whilst on guard, they will attack anyone who tries to attack them.
__Details__
The Guardsman may choose to be on guard for the rest of the night. This is an immediate ability, and it can only be done once.
If the Guardsman is attacked whilst on guard, they survive and attack the attacker. They will be informed that they counterattacked a player, but not whom. The Guardsman can attack multiple times whilst on guard.
If they attack a townsfolk-aligned player, the Guardsman is informed and dies at the end of the next night.

__Simplified__
The guardsman may go on guard once at night. If attacked, they survive and counterattack the attacker.
If they kill a townsfolk-aligned player, the Guardsman is informed and dies at the end of the next night.
