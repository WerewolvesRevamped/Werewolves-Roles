**Cerberus** | Solo Killing - Hell Team | Limited
__Basics__
Each night the Cerberus may guard a player, if attacked they will be protected in exchange for their soul, will be used to attack their attacker.
The Cerberus wins with the devil. It joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.
The Cerberus can use the hell team's soul pool.
__Details__
Each night the Cerberus can select a player to guard, they may not select soulless players.
If attacked the Cerberus will protect their target and in exchange take their soul, making them soulless, if the player has no soul they will no longer be protected.
However, the soul does not add to hell's collective soul pool, and instead the Cerberus uses it to attack the player who attacked their target.

During the first phase, the Cerberus may choose a role as a weak disguise. This defaults to citizen.

At the start of the game, the Cerberus' soul is added to the hell team's soul pool. The Cerberus then becomes soulless.
The Cerberus may use souls from the pool to protect or attack a player.
If the Cerberus is attacked while a soul is in the pool, a soul will automatically be used to protect the Cerberus.
See `$info souls` for a detailed explanation.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion or recruitment of a member will fail in some manner.
