**Cerberus** | Solo Power - Hell Team | Limited
__Basics__
The Cerberus wins with the devil and joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely. 
The Cerberus can choose every day to send an offer of protection to another player in exchange for their soul.
__Details__
During the first phase, the Cerberus may choose a role as a weak disguise (defaults to citizen).

At the start of the game the Cerberus’ soul is added to the hell team’s pool of souls, and they are soulless afterwards. 
The Cerberus cannot use souls from the soul pool.

The Cerberus can't send the offer to soulless players. The offer is sent at the start of the night. The offer cannot be redirected onto another player.
The Cerberus can anonymously communicate with the recipient.
The recipient accept or ignore the offer. Accepting the offer, immediately adds the recipient's soul to the soul pool, and cannot be changed. 
Should the recipient be attacked and die after accepting the offer, the Cerberus dies instead and the role and identity of the attacker is revealed in the Hell team’s channel.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way.

If the Cerberus is the last living member of the Hell team/channel, they turn into a demon.
