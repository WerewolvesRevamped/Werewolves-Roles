**Imp** | Solo Miscellaneous - Hell Team | Transformation
__Basics__
The Imp wins with the devil. It joins a channel with the devil to communicate securely.
__Details__
Any case of a second devil or cerberus occuring causes the player who would have become a devil or cerberus to become an Imp.
The Imp's win condition is the same as that of the devil. When the Imp is created, its soul is added to the hell team's soul pool. The Imp then becomes soulless.
Imps cannot use souls, but can be automatically protected on attack if there are souls in the hell team's soul pool.

Members of the Hell team cannot betray the team in any way. Any attempts at conversion of a member will fail in some manner.
