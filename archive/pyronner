**Pyronner** | Pyro Killing | Archived
__Basics__
Each night, the Pyronner may either powder a player or ignite all currently powdered players. Once per game, if attacked, the Pyronner shall escape.
__Details__
Each night the Pyronner may either powder a player or ignite all currently powdered people. Powdering is an immediate ability, and igniting is an end night ability. Instead of powdering the Pyronner may also unpowder.
When they are attacked, the Pyronner will not die, but will be vulnerable to future attacks. Pyronners are informed that they were attacked.

__Simplified__
The Pyronner is a variant of the pyromancer, with one exception: They will be protected from the first night attack to target them.
