__Basics__
On first death or attack, the Apprentice will pick up the role of whoever is attacked.
__Details__
The Apprentice will stay as an Apprentice until someone is either attacked or killed, thereafter they will pick up the role of the dead, and join the team they were on. 
If multiple people are attacked or killed at the same time, the Apprentice will pick up a random of the attack / dead people’s roles, but it will not be revealed from who the role came from.
