**Gray Werewolf** | Solo Killing - White Wolves | Archived
__Basics__
The Gray Werewolf is a werewolf who is not satisfied with merely killing the townsfolk; they must kill all the werewolves as well. 
Every other night, the White Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack.
__Details__
The Gray Werewolf is similar to the White Werewolf. A difference is that the Gray Werewolf can also win while one other player is alive. 
The Gray Werewolf wins when the only remaining players are the Gray Werewolf and optionally another player. The other player also wins, however the rest of their team does not. 
Unlike the White Werewolf, the Gray Werewolf does not have a disguise. 
Starting with Night 2, the Gray Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack every other night. If they choose not to attack, they will once again have the option to attack in the following night.
Attacking a member of the wolfpack is an end effect.
The Gray Werewolf is not part of the werewolf team, but is still considered a lycan and is part of the wolfpack.
