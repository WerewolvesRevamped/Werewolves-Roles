**Gray Werewolf** | Solo Killing | Archived
__Basics__
The Gray Werewolf is a werewolf who is not satisfied with merely killing the townsfolk; they must kill all the werewolves as well. 
On even numbered nights, the Gray Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack.
__Details__
The Gray Werewolf is similar to the White Werewolf. A difference is that the Gray Werewolf can also win while one other player is alive. 
The Gray Werewolf wins when the only remaining players are the Gray Werewolf and optionally another player. The other player also wins, however the rest of their team does not. 
Unlike the White Werewolf, the Gray Werewolf does not have a disguise. 
Attacking a member of the wolfpack is an end effect.
If only werewolves and the Gray Werewolf are left alive, the game will continue until either all werewolves are dead or the Gray Werewolf is dead.
The Gray Werewolf is not part of the werewolf team, but is still considered a lycan and is part of the wolfpack.

__Simplified__
The Gray Werewolf is similar to the White Werewolf. A difference is that the Gray Werewolf can also win while one other player is alive.
