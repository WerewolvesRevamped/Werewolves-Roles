**Spirit** | Solo Miscellaneous - Nightmare Team | Archived
__Basics__
The Spirit is a part of the reaperâ€™s secret army and pretends to be their old role. When the reaper uses an align power on a player, they become a Spirit.
__Details__
The Spirit wins together with the reaper.
A player converted into a Spirit loses their previous role. However, if they were a member of a group channel, they will remain as such and will still be able to vote if applicable (though their vote will not count).  
If all members of a group have changed role or died, the group is disbanded and any abilities it may have had are lost.

__Simplified__
The Spirit is a part of the reaper's team. If the reaper uses a conversion power on a player, they become a Spirit, losing their previous role.
