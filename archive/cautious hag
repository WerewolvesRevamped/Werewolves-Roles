__Basics__
The Cautious Hag can win with any team, unless that team has wronged the coven: however, the Cautious Hag cannot win if the coven has never been wronged.
The Cautious Hag can protect a player and disguise them at the same time.
__Details__
The Cautious Hag is one of the hags (`$i hags`).
During the night, the Cautious Hag may use any quantity of their spells to protect players. The Cautious Hag may protect themself. This power is not affected by redirections. 
Protecting a player is an immediate ability. Protected players will be immune to attacks for the rest of the night. If the protected player is a hag, they can also not be affected by any other action that is counted as “wronging” (e.g. Transformations). Additionally, the protected player will be strongly disguised as a role chosen by the Cautious Hag for the rest of the night.
The Cautious Hag is strongly disguised as a Hag.
The Cautious Hag is coven-aligned.
