**Packless Wolf** | Werewolf Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Packless Wolf has no ability and only joins the wolfpack if no members of the wolfpack are left.
__Details__
The Packless Wolf is a member of the werewolf team, that is not part of the wolfpack. 
Once all members of the wolfpack, which includes white werewolves and werewolves, that have lost their role, are dead all Packless Wolves join the wolfpack. 
If the last member of the wolfpack dies, but a player with a role such as Lone Wolf joins the wolfpack immediately, the Packless Wolf does not join the wolfpack. 
Packless Wolves are usually cursed civilians, that have been turned by a werewolf attack.
