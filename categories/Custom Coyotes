**Coyotes**
*The Coyotres are a secondary wolf group, containing (usually) one Greater Coyote. The coyotes and the wolfpack do not know each other, but have the same alignment. If the wolfpack fails to kill a townsfolk, the coyotes can attack a player in the next night, but if the Greater Coyotes dies, they lose their ability and join the wolfpack instead.*
