**Lycans**
Most, but not all members of the Werewolf Team are lycans. This is relevant for roles such as the Priest. Unless explicitly listed otherwise, all members of the Werewolf Team are lycans. Lycans are those members of the werewolf team that truly are werewolves, and not just allies of the werewolves (e.g. while foxes are part of the werewolf team they aren't truly werewolves, so they aren't lycans).
