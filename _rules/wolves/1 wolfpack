**Wolfpack**
Most of the werewolves (Members of the Werewolf Team) are also part of the wolfpack. All members of the wolfpack know each other and receive a secret channel to communicate among themselves securely. Each night, the wolfpack votes to attack one player. Not all members of the wolfpack necessarily are also werewolves. Unless explicitly listed otherwise, all members of the Werewolf Team are also part of the pack.
If there are no werewolves or lycans left in the wolfpack, the wolfpack is disbanded.
