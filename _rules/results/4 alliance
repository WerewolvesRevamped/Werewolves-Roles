**Alliance**
In rare cases the result 'Alliance' may be possible. This result is given to players that deliberately betray their own team to join another team (thus allying with an enemy team, before joining it). As this is generally considered to be gamethrowing, this result is only given rarely. Any attempt to try to achieve this result should be checked and confirmed by the Hosts of the game. Some cases where Alliance may be allowed are the following:
• The entire team is still alive, but cannot win. However they can all change to a different alignment and win that way.
• Neither winning, nor killing enemies is possible, but all remaining players of the team can change to a different alignment and win that way.
