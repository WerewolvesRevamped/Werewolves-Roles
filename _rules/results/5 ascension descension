**Ascension & Descension**
Unaligned players may leave the game early with either a live win (ascension) or a death loss (descension).
This happens when they complete their win condition (ascension), or when winning becomes impossible for them (descension). Generally players die when they ascend/descend (An ascension counts as a live win even if the player dies as a part of it). All ascensions/descensions, as well as the role of the ascending/descending player are announced.
