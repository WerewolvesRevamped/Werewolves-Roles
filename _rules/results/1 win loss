**Win/Loss**
Games will usually end with a win for one team, and a loss for all other teams. This will usually happen when only one team (and potentially unaligned players) remain, but some solo teams may also win if enemies remain alive if a certain criteria is met (flute team wins as long as all enemies are either dead or enchanted). 
Some Unaligned roles may leave the game early with a win (ascension) or loss (descension).

Win Conditions are evaluated at the start of any phase (before anything else happens), as well as after the completion of each immediate action, including all its consequences.
