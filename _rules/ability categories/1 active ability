__Basics__
Active Abilities are abilities directly resulting from a player's action.
__Details__
When a player uses an *action* to trigger an ability, the ability is active. When a fortune teller investigates a player immediately or when an assassin attacks a player at the end of the phase, they use an Active Ability.
