**Reactive Ability** | Ability Category
__Basics__
Reactive Abilities are used automatically, but their occurence and target are dependent on the player having previously used an ability to select a target.
__Details__
Reactive abilities are similiar to passive abilities, but differ in that a Reactive Ability only becomes available to be used because the player has previously selected a target through a separate ability. The huntress targets a player as an active ability, which then lets them attack the targeted player upon death as a Reactive Ability. The cult leader creates the cult poll as a passive ability, which then lets them attack the player selected as a target through the poll as a Reactive Ability. The devil actively creates a wager choice which determines the type of ability and target that will be executed as a Reactive Ability upon the wager recipients choice. The chef actively targets a player and additionally actively creates a choice which determines whether the Reactive Ability will occur.
