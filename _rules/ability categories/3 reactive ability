**Reactive Ability** | Ability Category
__Basics__
Reactive Abilities are used automatically, but can only be used after the player has used a related ability.
__Details__
Reactive abilities are similiar to passive abilities, but differ in that a Reactive Ability only becomes available to be used because the player has previously used a separate ability. The huntress targets a player as an active ability, which then lets them attack the targeted player upon death as a Reactive Ability. The cult leader creates the cult poll as a passive ability, which then lets them attack the player chosen on the poll as a Reactive Ability.
