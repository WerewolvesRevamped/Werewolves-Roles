**Group** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
In Werewolves Revamped, some players are part of groups. A player's group may grant them additional abilities and/or attributes. Groups also sometimes have shared abilities that don't belong to any single player.
__Details__
Groups may be disbanded, which also automatically happens when no members remain. If a group is disbanded due to lack of members, it may be reopened if a new member joins the group. If a group has any abilities, they are no longer used after disbandement. 
Each Group comes with a shared channel and all members know each other. When a Group is disbanded while members are still in it, the channel becomes locked, but is still viewable.
