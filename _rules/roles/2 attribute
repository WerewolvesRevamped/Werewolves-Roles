**Attribute** | Werewolves Revampmed
__Basics__
Attributes are qualities that players or roles have that affect role interactions and in some cases win conditions.
__Details__
There are two categories of attributes: standard and custom attributes. Standard attributes are defined by the general game rules and custom attributes are defined specifically in connection to a team/role.
Attributes consist out of several elements:
• Attribute Type: The type of attribute. This can be an attribute from the standard category (e.g. "disguise") or a custom attribute (e.g. "powdered"). The definition of the attribute type determines what, if anything, the attribute does.
• Attribute Values: Each attribute has several values, which may (or may not) be used by the attribute to influence its behaivor. Each attribute automatically comes with two values: source player (storing which player applied the attribute) and source role (storing the role o the player who applied the attribute).
• Attribute Duration: All attributes can be removed manually, but some attribute will disappear automatically after a certain amount of time. Persistent attributes never disappear, permanent attributes last until role loss and phase attributes last until the end of the current phase. Attributes may also define other more specific durations.
