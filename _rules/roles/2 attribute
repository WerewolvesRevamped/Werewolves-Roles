**Attribute** | Werewolves Revampmed
__Basics__
Attributes are qualities that players or roles have that affect role interactions and in some cases win conditions.
__Details__
There are two types of attributes:
• Role Attributes: Attributes that are role specific and are lost if your role changes. (e.g. being a lycan)
• Player Attributes: Attributes that are possessed regardless of role. (e.g. having a disguise applied from another role)
