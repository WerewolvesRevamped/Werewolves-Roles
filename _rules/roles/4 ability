Abilities can either be manually or automatically used by players in order to affect the game in various ways. To trigger a manual ("active") ability, players can use an *action* (see `$i action`). Other abilities are used automatically.

Abilities consist out of two different elements. Abilities are assigned to a role/player, hereafter referred as the current player.

  ‣ Reactive: Abilities used automatically, but that can only be used after the player has used a related ability
  ‣ Starting: Abilities automatically used at the start of the game
• Ability Type: Abilities are split into various types. Each ability has exactly one type. Find a list of types under `$i ability types`.
