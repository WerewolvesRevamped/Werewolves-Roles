**Ability** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
Abilities can either be manually or automatically used by players in order to affect the game in various ways. To trigger a manual ("active") ability, players can use an *action* (see `$i action`). Other abilities are used automatically.
__Details__
Most roles have one or several abilities.
Abilities consist out of three different elements. Abilities are assigned to a role/player, herefore refered as the current player.
• Ability Categories:
  ‣ Active: Abilities directly resulting from the current player's action
  ‣ Passive: Abilities resulting completely indepedent of any of the current player's actions, but possibly occuring directly as the consequence of another player's action
  ‣ Reactive: Abilities occuring passively, but with a target that was selected through a previous active action
  ‣ Starting: Abilities automatically used at the start of the game
• Ability Type: Abilities are split into various different types. Each ability has exactly one type. Find a list of types under `$i ability types`.
• Ability Compulsion: Some active abilities are forced abilities. Forced abilities can't be blocked and if they are not used, they are automatically executed with a random target instead. If a forced ability is automatically used that way, it is still considered to be active.
