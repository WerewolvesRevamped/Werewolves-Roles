**Ability** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
Abilities can be used by players either manually or automatically in order to affect the game in various ways. To trigger a manual ("active") ability, players can use an *action* (see `$i action`). Other abilities are used automatically.
__Details__
Most roles have one or several abilities.
Abilities consist out of two different elements. Abilities are assigned to a role/player, hereafter referred to as the current player.
• Ability Categories:
  ‣ Active: Abilities directly resulting from the current player's action
  ‣ Passive: Abilities used automatically and indepedently of any of the current player's actions
  ‣ Reactive: Abilities used automatically, but their occurence and target are dependent on the player having previously used an ability to select a target
  ‣ Starting: Abilities automatically used when the player gains the role
• Ability Type: Abilities are split into various types. Each ability has exactly one type. Find a list of types under `$i ability types`.
