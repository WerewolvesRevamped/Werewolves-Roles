**Role** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
In Werewolves Revamped, each player is assigned a role. A player's role determines their abilities, alignment, and win condition.
__Details__
Roles come in five groups: townsfolk, werewolves, solo, unaligned, and extra.
Townsfolk, werewolves, and solo roles each have an alignment, which defines their win condition.
Unaligned roles start as nonaligned and have either a specific win condition or the potential to gain an alignment.
Extra roles are added on top of a player's primary role and do not affect their alignment or win condition. Where a player's 'role' is referenced, the role in question is the primary role: only when a player's 'roles' are referenced does this include any extra roles they have.
Roles also specify the abilities the player starts out with. These may be passive, active or reactive powers. Role abilities are split into various ability types (see `$i ability types`). Active powers are used through actions, other powers are used automatically.
Roles also have role attributes, which are attached to the role (e.g. a role's category or whether a role is wolfish).
Each role (including extra roles) comes with a role channel.
