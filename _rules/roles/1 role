**Role** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
In Werewolves Revamped, each player is assigned a Role. A player's Role determines their abilities, alignment, and win condition.
__Details__
Roles come in five groups: townsfolk, werewolves, solo, unaligned, and extra.
Townsfolk, werewolves, and solo Roles each have an alignment, which defines their win condition.
Unaligned Roles start as nonaligned and have either a specific win condition or the potential to gain an alignment.
Extra Roles are added on top of a player's primary Role and do not affect their alignment or win condition. Where a player's 'Role' is referenced, the Role in question is the primary Role: only when a player's 'Roles' are referenced does this include any extra Roles they have.
Roles also specify the abilities the player starts out with. Role abilities are split into various ability types (see `$i ability types`).
Roles also have Role attributes, which are attached to the Role (e.g. a Role's category or whether a Role is wolfish).
Each Role (including extra Roles) comes with a Role channel.
