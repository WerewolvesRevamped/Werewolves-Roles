**Role** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
In Werewolves Revamped, each player is assigned a role. A player's role determines their abilities and win conditions.
__Details__
Each role comes with an alignment (townsfolk, werewolves, one of several solo teams or unaligned) or is considered an extra role which is added on top of a player's primary role. Roles also specify the abilities the player starts out with. Each role also comes with several attributes, which are attached to the role (e.g. a role's category or whether a role is wolfish).
