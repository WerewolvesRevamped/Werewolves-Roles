**Alignment** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
An Alignment is a group of players who share a win condition.
__Results:__
All players that are part of an alignment share the same win condition for the entire duration of the game, unless one of them is affected by a *role change*. During some points of the game, there may be (groups of) players that share a win condition but not an alignment. This can happen when one of the (groups of) players has the potential to change win condition (without a role change).
All players are either part of an alignment (even if they are the only player in them) or are considered to be nonaligned. Only players from the *unaligned* category can be nonaligned and only they can change alignment without a role change. Nonaligned players still have a win condition, however their win condition is personal to them and cannot be shared with another player.
