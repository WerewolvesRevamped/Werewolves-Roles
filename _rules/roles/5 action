**Action** | Werewolves Revamped
__Basics__
A player may submit an Action to use one of their active abilities.
__Details__
An Action is tied to one or more abilities. Actions consist of several elements:

• Action Timing: Actions have different timings, which determine when the connected ability get used. (Day/Night) Immediate Actions trigger their ability immediately. End (day/night) phase Actions trigger their ability at the end of a certain phase. Start (day/night) phase Actions trigger their ability at the start of a certain phase. Compound Actions trigger multiple abilities and may combine several action timings.
Once an immediate Action is submitted, it cannot be cancelled or changed: it is immediately evaluated. End phase Actions can be cancelled or changed until the ability is triggered. Compound Actions can be cancelled or changed until the first Action is triggered.

• Action Restriction: Action restrictions block certain Actions from being possible. Action restrictions include temporal restrictions (being unable to use an Action during certain phases), attribute restrictions (being unable to use an Action whilst possessing a certain attribute), succession restrictions (being unable to use consecutive Actions on the same target) and quantity restrictions (being only able to use an action a certain amount of times)
When an Action triggers several abilities at the same time, they are executed in parallel (unless specified otherwise): all abilities will occur indepedently and will not affect the execution of the other abilities.

• Action Scaling: Actions may scale, in that the amount of times they may be used (overall or during a single phase) is affected by player count.

• Action Compulsion: Some Actions are forced Actions. The abilities from forced Actions cannot be blocked. If a forced Action is not used voluntarily, it is instead automatically executed with any selections or choices randomised. An Action being automatically executed does not affect ability activity status.
