**Event Order**
The order of various events throughout day and night.

__Day__ 
Start Day Effects - Start day effects happen after end night effects and their consequences have been fully completed - if the player doing them is still alive. 

Immediate Day Effects - Effects that happen immediately during the game. For example barber's kill.

Lynch - The lynch poll is closed and votes are counted, a winner is chosen but nothing else happens.
Election - The election poll is closed and votes are counted, a winner is chosen but nothing else happens.
Lynch Block - The lynch is possibly cancelled (Royal Knight).
Election Block - The election is possibly cancelled (Corrupt Wolf).
Lynch Consequences - The lynch winner is lynched, and consequences (death/ascension) of it happen.
Election Consequences - The election winner is elected, and consequences (election/ascension) of it happen.

End Day Effects - End day effects (e.g. Chef's Poison) happen - if the player doing them is still alive.
End Day Effect Consequences - Consequences of the end day effects happen (e.g. somebody being poisoned).

__Night__
Start Night Effects - Start night effects (e.g. Devil's Wager) happen after end day effects and their consequences have been fully completed - if the player doing them is still alive. 

Immediate Night Effects - Effects that happen immediately during the game. For example most investigations.

End Night Effects - End night effects happen. E.g. the wolfpack's kill. If a player is alive during this stage and executes an effect, the effect happens even if they die as a consequence of an end night effect.
End Night Effects Consequences - Consequences of the end night effects happen (e.g. somebody being attacked).

__Conflicts__
If several abilities happen at the same time the following rules are applied. Non-attacks happen before attacks. Attacks are ordered according to the attack order rules.
Non-attack abilities are prioritized according to alphabetical sorting. If a conflict still exists a random player is chosen to be prioritized.
