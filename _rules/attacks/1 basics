**Basics**
Many roles or groups can attack. Attacks generally result in the attacked player get killed. The player attacking another player is known as “Attacker”.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, an attack is considered successful if *any* player (even if that person wasn't the intended target) ends up dead as a result of the attack and unsuccessful otherwise.
If the target of an attack was already killed by another attack occuring at the same time, then the attack is still considered a success.
