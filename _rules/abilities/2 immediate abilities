**Immediate Abilities** | Ability Information
Most Immediate Abilities can only be used once per phase. Additionally, abilities like targetting usually have an emergency change once per game.
Targeting abilities (e.g. Executioner) are lost when the main power (e.g. lynching another player) has already be used.
