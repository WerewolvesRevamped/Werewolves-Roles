**Delaying Abilities**
Delaying Immediate Abilities is possible in three ways:
1) An immediate ability can be chosen one phase before it has to be executed (e.g. a Fortune Teller choosing a target during the day). If this is the case, the Game Masters will execute the immediate ability at an arbitrary time during its phase (the time can not be chosen).
2) An immediate ability may be executed roughly 15 minutes before the next phase change, if requested. If several conflicting immediate abilities are delayed this way, the order in which they were requested is preserved. Abilities delayed this way can be cancelled/rerequested.
3) An end-day/start-night ability or an end delayed immediate day ability (using 2) may be chosen with an additional 'if my target dies, target this person/nobody instead' condition. This only applies if the target is visibly lynched. Should the target unexpectedly die, the condition won't be used.
