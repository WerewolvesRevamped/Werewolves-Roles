__Details__
Through various other abilities (See `$i disguises`, `$i obstructions`, and `$i redirections`) investigations are not always guaranteed to return an accurate result. The most generic type of investigation is to see another player's role (e.g. Fortune Teller), however many other types of investigation exist (e.g. Oracle). Investigations usually, but not always, happen immediately.
