**Targeting** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Targeting is a type of ability that on its own does not do much. Targeting is usually used by roles that cannot decide when their primary ability triggers, so in advance they may select a player (or other type of target) that should be targeted by their ability once it does trigger.
__Details__
Examples of this are the Huntress, who attacks a targeted player on death, or the Executioner who lynches a targeted player if lynched. Targeting is generally immediate and is limited to one use per phase, with one emergency use the player may use at any point in the game.
