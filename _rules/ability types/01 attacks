**Attacks**
Attacks are a type of ability that aims to kill another player, however success of this isn't guaranteed (See Protections/Defenses), making it different from killing (however killing isn't always guaranteed to succeed either). Some of the most generic attacks are the Assassin and the Wolfpack. Attacks usually, but not always, happen at the end of a phase. When an attack succeeds, the attacked player is killed.
Attacks are explained in detail in the Attacks section.
Most roles with the ability to attack are considered _Killing_ roles.
