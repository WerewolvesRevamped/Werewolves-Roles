**Loyalty** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Loyalty is a passive ability that stops a role from betraying their alignment or group.
__Details__
There are two types of loyalty:
• Alignment Loyalty: Some roles are loyal to their alignment - they cannot be affected by attempts to be recruit them onto another team
• Group Loyalty: Some roles are only loyal to their group - they can still betray the group, but there may be consequences for the group (e.g. disbandment)
