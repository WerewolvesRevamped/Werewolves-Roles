**Joining (Group Membership)** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Joining is an ability type that grants a player membership of a group.
__Details__
Joining refers to the ability to join a group by receiving a group membership attribute. Losing a role with a Joining ability will not affect membership in the group.
Joining is usually a starting ability (e.g. Baker, Wolf). Some roles can join groups at a later point in the game, either passively (e.g. Lone Wolf) or actively (e.g. Disguised Fox). 
Roles which have a Joining ability that does not grant them membership of a primary team group are Group roles (unless they also qualify to be in a category with higher priority).
Players can betray their group if their role changes (e.g. by turning undead), but they will still remain a member of the group.

There are three types of group membership:
• Member: The default group membership. If no members or owners are left, the group is immediately disbanded.
• Owner: If the last owner of a group dies, the group is immediately disbanded. Groups do not need to have an owner.
• Visitor: If only visitors are left, the group is immediately disbanded.
