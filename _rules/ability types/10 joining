**Joining (Group Membership)** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Joining is an ability type that grants a player a group membership. Roles with a joining ability are *Group* roles.
__Details__
While more commonly refered to as Group Membership, the actual ability is 'joining' and refers to the ability to join a group by receiving a group membership attribute. This means losing a role with a group membership ability will not affect your membership in the group.
Usually roles are part of a group from the start of the game (e.g. Baker, Wolf), however some roles can join groups at a later point in the game, either passively (e.g. Lone Wolf) or actively (e.g. Disguised Fox). 
Roles that join a group as part of a team wide ability are *not* considered to be *Group* roles.
In some games, player can betray their group by changing their role (e.g. by turning undead or being infected by the Infecting Wolf), however they will still remain a member of the group.

There are three types of group membership:
• Member: The default group membership. If no members or owners are left, the group is immediately disbanded.
• Owner: Same as Member, but if the last owner of a group dies, the group is immediately disbanded. Groups do not need to have an owner.
• Visitor: Same as Member, but does not count towards the disbandement condition. If only visitors are left, the group is immediately disbanded.
