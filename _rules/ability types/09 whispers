**Whispers** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Whispering is a type of ability that allows roles to anonymously communicate in some way. Whispering abilities are immune to redirection.
__Details__
When a whispering ability is used a whispering connection is opened. Depending on what is defined by the role this may stay open until the end of the game or until the end of a certain phase.
For a complete list of roles with whisper abilities, check `$i whispers list`.
Examles: The Bartender may anonymously send messages in the tavern channel, while roles such as the Corrupt Wolf can anonymously communicate with one player of their choice each day.
Whispering always comes with a whisper talk channel for the role that has the whispering ability, and in some cases, but not always, with a whisper target channel. In some cases, instead of a new whisper target channel, an existing channel is used (e.g. Bartender whispers to tavern channel and devil whispers to the wager recipient extra role's channel)
