**Disguises** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Disguises can affect what information an investigation retrieves by applying a disguise attribute. Disguises change the role a player appears as.
__Details__
A disguising ability applies a disguise attribute to a player.
Disguises may be either weak or strong. Disguises are applied in chronological order: an investigative role will see the most recently applied disguise of the strength they are affected by. Only investigative roles which inspect a player's role or a role-relevant attribute are affected by disguises (e.g warlock, aura teller).
Some disguises are permanent (stay until manually removed or role change) and others are non-permanent (disappear automatically after a certain phase).

A sneaking wolf who has during the previous phase been disguised as a demon by a pack tanner will have two disguises: a strong citizen disguise and a weak demon disguise. A fortune teller would see the sneaking wolf as a demon; an aura teller would see them as a non-threat; a huntsman would see them as part of the pack.
