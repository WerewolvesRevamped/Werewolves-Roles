**Disguises** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Disguises affect what role an investigative role sees a player as when inspecting them.
__Details__
Disguises may be either weak or strong. Disguises are applied in chronological order: an investigative role will see the most recently applied disguise of the strength they are affected by. As a general rule, only investigative roles which inspect a player's role (or an attribute of the role) are affected by disguises (e.g Warlock, Aura Teller). Investigative roles which inspect other attributes, such as alignment (e.g Oracle, Huntsman) generally see past any disguises.

• Permanent disguises are chosen once, usually at the start of the game (e.g Devil).
• Semi-permanent disguises are permanent disguises which the player may choose to change at any point (e.g Psychopath) or are permanent unless removed by source (e.g. Horseman of Famine).
• Non-permanent disguises usually last a single phase and, unlike permanent and semi-permanent disguises, may be applied to a player by a different player (e.g Tanner).

Take a Sneaking Wolf who has during the last day phase been disguised as a Demon by a Pack Tanner. During the night phase, the player will have two disguises, a strong permanent Citizen disguise and a weak non-permanent Demon disguise. A Fortune Teller would see the Sneaking Wolf as a Demon, as that is the most recent disguise; an Aura Teller would see the Sneaking Wolf as not a threat, as they are only affected by strong disguises; a Huntsman would see the Sneaking Wolf as part of the pack, as they are not affected by disguises at all (they check pack status, not role).

__Simplified__
Disguising is a type of ability that aids in hiding from Investigative abilities. There are strong and weak disguises. Some roles have a disguise they can not alter (e.g. White Werewolf, Devil), others can even disguise other people (e.g. Tanner).
