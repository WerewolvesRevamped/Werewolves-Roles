**Protections** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Protections are a type of ability which is intended to stop killings from succeeding. A protected player will not be harmed by attacks - instead they will be defended.
__Details__
Protections grant a defense attribute which protect from certain types of killings. There are four types of defense attributes:
• Absences (such as hooker)
• Effect Based Defenses (such as the witch's potion of life or the chef's charmed food)
• Role Based Defenses (such as runner or scared wolf)
• Partial Defenses (such as macho or idiot)

Defense attributes can have limitations applied that limit from what they protect:
• Killing Type Limitation: Limits from which types of killing the defense protects (e.g. only from attacks)
• Phase Limitation: Limits in which phase the defense protects (e.g. only during night)
• Killing Source Limitation: Limits killings from which sources are protected against (e.g. only killings from a wolfish player)

For killing, lynching and attack all four defense attribute types apply, though most defensive attributes limit themselves to only apply to attacks.

__Simplified__
Protections are a type of ability which applies a defense attribute to protect from killings.
