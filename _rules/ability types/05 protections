**Protections** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Protections are a type of ability which can block killings from succeeding.
__Details__
Protections grant a defense attribute which can protect against certain types of killings. There are four types of defense attributes:
• Absences: The player is not present for the attack (such as hooker)
• Active Defenses: An effect blocks the killing (such as the witch's potion of life)
• Passive Defenses: A defense built in to the player's role blocks the killing (such as runner)
• Partial Defenses: A defense built in to the player's role prevents them from dying at the point of attack, but has other consequences (such as macho or idiot)

Defense attributes can have limitations applied that limit from what they protect:
• Type Limitation: Limits which types of killing the defense protects against (e.g. only from attacks)
• Phase Limitation: Limits in which phases the defense protects (e.g. only during night)
• Source Limitation: Limits which sources of killings the defense protects against (e.g. only killings from a wolfish player)

Protections may block standard killings, attacks, and lynches.

__Simplified__
Protections are a type of ability which applies a defense attribute to protect from killings.
