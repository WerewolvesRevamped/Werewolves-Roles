**Redirections** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Redirections are abilities that redirect attacks, investigations and/or other actions onto another player. By default, all roles are affected by redirections, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
__Details__
If an attack is redirected onto another player, the attacker(s) is/are not informed of this. They simply get a generic failure message and may use #storytime to deduce what happened.
If an action that would usually cause a reveal is redirected, the feedback is also failure. The action still happens (but with the player it was redirected onto and not the original target), but the original executor is not revealed.
If any other action (for example investigation or targetting) is redirected, the action happens as if it was directly used on the player who it is redirected on to, but it is not stated that the ability was used on a different player than selected.
When an action is redirected it is still attributed to the player that originally executed it and not the player that redirected it. Actions may be redirected several times in a row.
Actions can not be redirected onto a dead player, and, if attempted, the redirection doesn't happen and the action happens as usual.

For a complete list of disguises check `$i redirections list`.
 
__Simplified__
Redirections are a rare type of ability that changes the selected player of another player's ability to a different one. This generally means that using an ability on a redirector will result in the ability happening with/to the redirector's target instead.
