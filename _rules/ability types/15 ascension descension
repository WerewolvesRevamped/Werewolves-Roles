**Ascension & Descension** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Unaligned players may leave the game early with either a live win (ascension) or a death loss (descension).
__Details__
This happens when they complete their win condition (ascension), or when winning becomes impossible for them (descension). When players ascend it will be treated as if they died and if they descend they actually die. In either case, their ascension/descension, as well as their role will be announced.
