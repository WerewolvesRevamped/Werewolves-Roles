**Lynching** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Lynching is most commonly done via the daily lynch vote. In this case it is considered a *direct* lynch.
__Details__
Lynches are different from attacks as most means of evading can't be used to evade the lynch. Lyching is similiar to killing, but not the same (things that save from killing do not necessarily save from lynching and vice versa).
An *indirect* lynch can occur if another role lynches instead of the daily lynch vote. This can happen when the Executioner is lynched, and instead lynches someone else in their place. Unless explicitly stated otherwise both types of lynches work the same way. Roles with the ability to indirectly lynch are considered _Killing_ roles.
