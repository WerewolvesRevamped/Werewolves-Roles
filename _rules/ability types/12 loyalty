**Loyalty** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Loyalty is a passive ability type that affects whether roles can betray their alignment or group.
__Details__
There are two types of loyalty:
• Alignment Loyalty: Some roles are loyal to their alignment - they cannot be affected by attempts to recruit them onto another team
• Group Loyalty: Some roles are only loyal to their group - they can still change role to a role that wouldn't be part of the group, but it will cause a *betrayal*, which causes consequences for the group and how it operates (e.g. disbandment)
