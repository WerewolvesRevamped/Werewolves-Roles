**Ability Blocks** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Ability Blocking is a rare type of ability that stops other players from successfully using their abilities.
__Details__
Ability blocked players are not informed they have been blocked, unless specified otherwise. When an ability blocked player attempts to use an ability the action will result in a failure. For some ability types, such as attacks, this will be indistinguishable from other types of failure (e.g. hitting a protected player is indistinguishable from the attack failing due to a ability block). However, for many ability types the only way the action can fail through ability blocking (e.g. investigations). For group actions (e.g. wolfpack attack), ability blocked players can still be chosen to execute the action, however if they are, the action will fail. Completely passive abilities, like Runner, as well as the ability to whisper, are not affected.
