**Applying** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Applying is an ability type that applies a custom attribute to a player.
__Details__
Applying itself does nothing beyond applying an attribute to a player, however each custom attribute has its own definition and potential effects, which may use various other ability types.
Instead of applying a custom attribute, an attribute (both standard and custom ones) may also be removed, in which case it is called 'Removing'.
