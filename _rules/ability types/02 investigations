__Basics__
Investigations retrieve information about the current game state. Roles with the ability to actively investigate are *Investigative* roles.
__Details__
Investigations retrieve information about the current game state. This generally means that they learn information about the role or actions of another player.
Like other abilities, Investigations may be affected by *redirections*. They may also be affected by *disguises* and *obstructions*. As such, Investigations may return false information.
There are several types of investigations:
• Role Investigation: See the role of a player.
• Alignment Investigation: See the alignment of a player.
• Category Investigation: See the category of a player's role.
• Attribute Investigation: See if a certain attribute is present on a player.
• Role Count Investigation: See the quantity of a certain role ingame.

__Simplified__
Investigations retrieve information about the current game state. Roles with the ability to actively investigate are *Investigative* roles. Redirections, obstructions and disguises may lead to Investigations returning false information.
