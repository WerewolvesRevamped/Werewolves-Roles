**Killing** | Ability Type
__Basics__
Killing is a type of ability which attempts to cause another player's death. Roles with the ability to kill other players are *Killing* roles. Killing can be avoided by being *protected*.
__Details__
There are four types of Killing:
• Standard Kills: This is usually referred to simply as "killing". In cases where the kill is accidental or passive, it may be referred to as "dying". This type of Killing can be avoided by some types of protection.
• Attacks: This is the most common type of Killing. Attacks can be blocked by all protections that block standard kills or attacks.
• Lynches: There are two types of lynches. A direct lynch occurs when the player in question is voted on a lynch poll. Indirect lynches are executed by a role. Lynches differ from standard kills in that they are affected by different types of protection.
• True Kills: This type of Killing can not be blocked by any types of protection.

Many roles or groups can kill. The player executing the Killing is known as the “Killer”/“Attacker”.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, a killing is considered successful if *any* player (even if they weren't the intended target) ends up dead as a result of the attack. The role or group responsible for the attack is informed of success or failure, but by default receives no information beyond that.
If the target of an attack is killed by another attack occuring at the same time, both attacks are considered successes.
__Groups__
When a group (such as Werewolves) attacks a player, a random member of the group (who voted for the target with at least 1 vote) is chosen as the attacker. The group is informed who is chosen. Unless explicitly listed otherwise, this attacker is considered the cause of the attack.
__Edge Cases__
For edge cases with conflicting attack order, check `$i killing order`.

__Simplified__
Killing is a type of ability which attempts to cause another player's death. Roles with the ability to kill other players are *Killing* roles. Killing can be avoided by being *protected*.
