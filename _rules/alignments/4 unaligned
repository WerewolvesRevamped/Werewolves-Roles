**Unaligned**
The unaligned are truly unique, they aren't part of any alignment. They make up about 10% of the players. Their goal is to fulfill their win condition. With that, they might even join an alignment. 
The ones that don't change alignment ascend when they win, leaving the game dead, but with a win in their pocket. As they have no alignment, they are free to work with whatever alignment they want.
Unaligned players are exempt from other teams' win conditions. For example, this means that the Werewolves can win with Unaligned players left alive, even though they are supposed to kill all other players. This does not apply for Unaligned players that join an alignment.
