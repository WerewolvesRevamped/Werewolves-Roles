**Unaligned**
The Unaligned are by default able to win with any other team. They make up about 10% of the players. Their goal is to fulfill their win condition. Many Unaligned roles are nonaligned, but some can acquire alignments.
Unaligned players are exempt from other teams' win conditions. For example, the Werewolves can win with Unaligned players left alive, even though they are supposed to kill all other players. This includes Unaligned players who have alignments, but not players who were previously Unaligned but have since changed role to one that is not Unaligned.
