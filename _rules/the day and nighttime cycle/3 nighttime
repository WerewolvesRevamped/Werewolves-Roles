**Nighttime**
In nighttime, most roles perform their role-specific actions, which can have an effect on the other roles and players in the game. During the night, actions are usually immediate actions (the result will be evaluated immediately) or end night action (the result will be evaluated at the end of the night).
Each Night is followed by a Day and vice versa.
