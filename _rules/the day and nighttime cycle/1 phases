**Phases**
Werewolves Revamped is split into phases. There are two types of phases: daytime and nightime.
The game is played in a real-time day/night cycle. That means that a day and a night added up in Werewolves Revamped always total 24 hours.
Depending on the game the length of the phases may vary, but usually nighttime is either as long or longer than daytime.
