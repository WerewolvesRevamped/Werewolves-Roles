**Wager Recipient** | Extra Power
__Basics__
When a devil chooses to send the wager to a player, that player becomes the Wager Recipient for the duration of the following night phase. The Wager Recipient may choose to use one of a variety of powers: each has a cost.
__Details__
During the day the devil may select a player to offer a wager to. At the start of the following night, the player will become the Wager Recipient and will be added to the wager channel.
The Wager Recipient may sell their soul to protect or kill a player; they may choose to investigate the role of a player, at the cost of the devil learning the Wager Recipient's own role; or they may do nothing (see `$i wager` for more information).
At the end of the night phase, the player leaves the wager channel and loses the Wager Recipient role. Any player who is not soulless may become the Wager Recipient, including players who have previously been the Wager Recipient.

__Simplified__
When a devil chooses to send the wager to a player, they become the Wager Recipient for the that night. The Wager Recipient may choose to use one of a variety of powers: each has a cost.
