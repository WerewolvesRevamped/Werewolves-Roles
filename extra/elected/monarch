**Monarch** | Extra Elected
__Basics__
The Monarch is elected during Day 0. They may select a heir, who has an extra vote and will inherit the Monarch role should the Monarch die.
__Details__
The Monarch will only be elected once. The first Monarch election occurs during Day 0: the election will reoccur until a Monarch is elected.
The Monarch can select another player as their heir; they can update this target once per phase, with 1 emergency change to be used whenever the Monarch wants. The original Monarch must select an heir: a random player will be chosen as heir if there is no current heir. This restriction does not apply to successive Monarchs, and they need not choose an heir.
The heir is not aware of being selected by the Monarch. If the Monarch dies, the heir becomes Monarch. This is not revealed.
The heir's vote appears normally on votes. An additional vote is counted internally, and the total vote count in the vote results will be correct. This extra vote is a special vote that works as the Mayor's extra vote does.
Selecting an heir is an immediate ability.

__Simplified__
The Monarch is elected during Day 0.
They may secretly pick a player to receive the Monarch role on the current Monarch's death.
Additionally, that player is granted an extra vote.
