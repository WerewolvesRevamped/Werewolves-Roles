**Mayor** | Extra Elected
__Basics__
The Mayor can post in #story_time. 
When there are 15 or less living players, the Mayor receives an extra vote in polls.
When there are more than 15 living players, each night the Mayor instead chooses whether a second player will be lynched during the next day. 
__Details__
The Mayor's extra vote cannot be nullified, stolen or removed under any circumstances.
If the Mayor's normal vote is a negative vote, the extra vote becomes a negative vote too.
The Mayor may resign at the end of any phase. 
The Mayor gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Mayors.

__Simplified__
The Mayor is elected before the other elected roles. They are able to post in #story_time.
When there are 15 or more players, they may decide that a second player will be lynched during the next day.
When there are less than 15 players, they instead get 2 votes on the public polls.
