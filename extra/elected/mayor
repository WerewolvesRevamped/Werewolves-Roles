**Mayor** | Extra Elected
__Basics__
The Mayor leads the town. They have the privilege of being able to post in #story_time. 
When there are more than 15 living players, each night the Mayor chooses whether a second player will be lynched during the next day. When there are 15 or less living players, the Mayor instead receives an extra vote in polls.
__Details__
The Mayor can be a powerful role to help either the innocent team or the werewolves team, but they tend to garner a lot of attention and may be killed quickly. 
If the Mayor misuses their ability to post in #story_time, they may be demoted or killed at the discretion of the Game Masters. 
If the mayor chooses that two people should be lynched, there will be a second lynch poll during the next day.
The Mayor's extra vote cannot be nullified, stolen or removed under any circumstances.
If the Mayor's normal vote is a negative vote, the extra vote becomes a negative vote too.

__Simplified__
The Mayor is elected before the other elected roles. They are able to post in #story_time.
When there are 15 or more players, they may decide that a second player will be lynched during the next day.
When there are less than 15 players, they instead get 2 votes on the public polls.
