**Mayor** | Extra Elected
__Basics__
The Mayor can post in #story_time.
When the number of living players are two-thirds of the total players or fewer, the Mayor receives an extra vote in polls.
When there are more living players than that, each night, the Mayor instead chooses whether a second lynch will take place during the next day.
__Details__
The Mayor's extra vote cannot be nullified, stolen, or removed under any circumstances.
If the Mayor would normally have a negative vote, the extra vote becomes a negative vote too.
The Mayor may choose to resign at any point during a phase, but will only lose the role at the end of the phase.
Choosing a double lynch is an immediate action.
If the number of living players are no more than two-thirds of the total players, the Mayor immediately gains the extra vote and loses the ability to choose whether there is an additional lynch. If this happens after they have chosen to have an additional lynch, but before the lynch poll occurs, the additional poll will still be created.
The Mayor gains an additional secret channel, which is reused for any subsequent Mayors.

__Simplified__
The Mayor is elected before the reporter and the guardian. They are able to post in #story_time.
When more than two-thirds of players remain alive, they may decide that a second player will be lynched during the next day.
When two-thirds of the total players or fewer are still alive, they instead get 2 votes on the public polls.
