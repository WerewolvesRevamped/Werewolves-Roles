**Journal Holder** | Extra Miscellaneous
__Basics__
The Journal Holder has access to a journal. 
__Details__
Journalists become Journal Holders as a starting ability. This gives them a journal channel in which they may write anything they wish. The journalist can target a role. When the journalist dies, one player with the targeted role will become the new Journal Holder and receive access to the journal. If there are no living players with the targeted role, the journal will be lost.
Each Journal Holder role is connected to an individual journal channel.
