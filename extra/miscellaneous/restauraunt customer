**Restauraunt Customer** | Extra Miscellaneous 

__Basics__
A player becomes a restaurant customer when a Chef invites them to their restaurant for a day phase, where they may choose whether or not to eat the chef's food

__Details__
When a chef selects a restaurant customer, their target will be added to a restaurant channel where the chef can anonymously communicate with the restaurant customer. The Chef selects one of two types of food ahead of time and the restaurant customer has the choice of eating it or not. 
Charmed food offers protection the following night phase and poisoned food kills the restaurant customer at the end of the day phase.
If a player eats a chef's food, they can no longer become a customer again.
At the end of the phase, the player leaves the restaurant and is no longer a restaurant customer.
