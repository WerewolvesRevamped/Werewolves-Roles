**Restauraunt Customer** | Extra Miscellaneous 

__Basics__
When a chef chooses to send food to a player, that player becomes a Restaurant Customer for the duration of the following day phase.

__Details__
When a chef selects a Restaurant Customer, their target will be added to a restaurant channel where the chef can anonymously communicate with them. The Restaurant Customer may choose whether to eat the food or not: they do not know whether it is charmed or poisoned. 
Charmed food offers protection for the duration of the following night phase. Poisoned food kills the restaurant customer at the end of the day phase.
If the Restauarnt Customer eats a chef's food, they can no longer become a Restauarant Customer again, even if a different chef attempts to send them food.
At the end of the day phase, the player leaves the restaurant and loses the Restaurant Customer role.
