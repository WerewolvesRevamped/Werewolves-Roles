**Journal** | Extra Miscellaneous

__Basics__
When a journalist dies a player receives their journal.

__Details__
A journalist has their own journal channel to write anything they want. They can also target a role. When the journalist dies, the journal will be given to a random person of the targeted role, giving them access to the journal channel. If there are no living players with the targeted role the journal will be lost.
